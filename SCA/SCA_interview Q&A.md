üîü **What are some popular SCA tools?**  
   - **Snyk, Black Duck, WhiteSource (Mend), OWASP Dependency-Check, JFrog Xray.**  

1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ **How does an SCA tool detect vulnerabilities?**

1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ **How does SCA help in DevSecOps?**  
   - **By integrating into CI/CD pipelines to detect vulnerabilities early.**  

1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ **How does an SCA tool check for license compliance?**  
   - **It scans dependencies and flags non-compliant licenses (GPL, MIT, Apache, etc.).**  

1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ **What is the difference between a direct and a transitive dependency?**  
   - **Direct dependencies are explicitly used, while transitive dependencies come from third-party libraries.**  

1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ **How does CVSS scoring impact vulnerability prioritization?**  
   - **Higher CVSS scores (7-10) indicate critical vulnerabilities needing immediate action.**  

1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ **What are some common licensing issues in open-source software?**  
   - **GPL enforcement, missing attribution, license incompatibility.**  

1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ **How can organizations manage open-source security risks?**  
   - **Use SCA tools, monitor CVEs, update dependencies, follow secure coding practices.**  

1Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ **What is the impact of outdated dependencies on software security?**  
   - **They may contain unresolved vulnerabilities that can be exploited.**  

1Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ **What is Semantic Versioning (SemVer)?**  
   - **A versioning system (Major.Minor.Patch) used to track software updates.**  

2Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ **What is OWASP Dependency-Check, and how does it work?**  
   - **A tool that scans dependencies for known CVEs using the NVD database.**

## **üîπ Hard Level Questions**  

2Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ **What is the difference between WhiteSource (Mend) and Black Duck?**  
   - **Both are SCA tools, but they differ in integration capabilities, reporting, and compliance tracking.**  

2Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ **How does SCA help in supply chain security?**  
   - **It prevents software supply chain attacks by identifying vulnerable dependencies.**  

2Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ **How can organizations automate SCA in CI/CD pipelines?**  
   - **Integrate SCA tools like Snyk or OWASP Dependency-Check into build pipelines.**  

2Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ **What is the role of SCA in software compliance (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS)?**  
   - **Ensures open-source components comply with security and legal standards.**  

2Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ **What are some challenges in implementing SCA?**  
   - **False positives, scanning large codebases, managing transitive dependencies.**  

2Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ **How does SCA help mitigate Log4j vulnerabilities?**  
   - **Identifies outdated Log4j versions and recommends updates.**  

2Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ **How does SBOM help in vulnerability management?**  
   - **Provides visibility into all software components, making it easier to track vulnerabilities.**  

2Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ **What is the difference between an exploit and a vulnerability?**  
   - **A vulnerability is a weakness; an exploit is an attack that takes advantage of it.**  

2Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ **What is the risk of not updating dependencies in an application?**  
   - **Potential exposure to known CVEs that attackers can exploit.**  

3Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ **What is the difference between an open-source license and a proprietary license?**  
   - **Open-source licenses allow modification and distribution, while proprietary licenses restrict usage.**
