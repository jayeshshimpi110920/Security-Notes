### **CSRF vs. SSRF – Key Differences & Explanation** 🚀  

Both **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)** and **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)** exploit trust relationships, but they target different entities.  

---

## **1️⃣ CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**
🔹 **What is CSRF?**  
- Forces a **victim’s browser** to make **unauthorized requests** on their behalf.  
- Exploits the fact that browsers **automatically send cookies** with requests to trusted sites.  
- **Targets authenticated users** to perform unintended actions.  

🔹 **Example Attack**  
1. Victim is **logged into a banking site** (`bank.com`).  
2. Attacker tricks them into clicking a malicious link:  
   ```html
   <img src="https://bank.com/transfer?to=attacker&amount=5000" />
   ```
3. Since the victim’s browser **automatically sends their session cookie**, the bank **processes the request** as if the user made it.  
4. **Money is transferred without user consent.**  

🔹 **Impact of CSRF**  
✅ Unauthorized actions on behalf of a **legitimate user** (e.g., fund transfers, password changes).  
✅ **Does NOT steal data** but **misuses user privileges**.  

🔹 **CSRF Prevention**  
✅ Use **CSRF tokens** in every state-changing request.  
✅ Require **re-authentication** for sensitive actions.  
✅ Implement **SameSite cookies** to block cross-origin requests.

## **2️⃣ SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)**
🔹 **What is SSRF?**  
- Exploits a vulnerable **server** to make requests to **internal or external resources**.  
- Allows attackers to access **internal services, metadata, or even escalate to RCE (Remote Code Execution).**  
- **Targets the web server itself**, not the user.  

🔹 **Example Attack**  
1. A website allows users to **fetch profile images** by URL:  
   ```html
   <img src="https://example.com/getImage?url=http://internal-service/admin">
   ```
2. The attacker changes the `url` parameter to access internal services:  
   ```
   https://example.com/getImage?url=http://localhost/admin
   ```
3. The server **fetches the internal page** and leaks restricted content.  

🔹 **Impact of SSRF**  
✅ **Access internal services** (e.g., databases, cloud metadata endpoints).  
✅ **Bypass firewalls** to reach internal networks.  
✅ **Port scanning & data exfiltration**.  
✅ May lead to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** if the internal service is vulnerable.  

🔹 **SSRF Prevention**  
✅ Restrict outgoing requests to **allowed domains** only.  
✅ Disable access to **internal IP ranges (127.0.0.1, 169.254.169.254)**.  
✅ Validate & sanitize user input.  
✅ Use **network segmentation** to prevent internal exposure.

### **🚀 CSRF vs. SSRF – Key Differences**
| Feature | **CSRF** | **SSRF** |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Target** | **User (via browser)** | **Server (internal/external requests)** |
| **Exploits** | **User's authentication session** | **Server’s ability to send requests** |
| **Requires User Interaction?** | ✅ Yes (tricking user into clicking a link) | ❌ No (direct server-side request manipulation) |
| **Typical Impact** | **Unintended user actions** (money transfers, settings change) | **Accessing internal services, metadata, RCE** |
| **Mitigation** | CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies, re-authentication | Restrict outgoing requests, allowlist URLs, network segmentation |

🔥 **In short:**  
- **CSRF tricks a victim into making unintended requests using their authenticated session.**  
- **SSRF tricks the server into making unintended requests to internal/external systems.**
