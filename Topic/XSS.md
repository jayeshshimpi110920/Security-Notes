## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Stored XSS: Malicious scripts are injected and stored on the server (e.g., in databases), and are executed in the userâ€™s browser when they visit the affected page.
* Reflected XSS: The malicious script is reflected off a web server and executed in the user's browser immediately.
* DOM-based XSS: The vulnerability exists in the client-side script, where malicious scripts can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM).
