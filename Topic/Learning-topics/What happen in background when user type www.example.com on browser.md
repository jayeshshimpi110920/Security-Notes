When a user types a URL like `www.example.com` into a web browser and presses enter, several steps happen behind the scenes to retrieve the webpage. Here's a detailed breakdown of the entire process from start to finish:

### 1. **DNS Resolution (Domain Name System)**
   - **URL Parsing**: The browser first checks if the URL is valid and determines the protocol (`HTTP` or `HTTPS`) and the domain name (`example.com`).
   - **Browser Cache**: The browser checks its local cache to see if it has the IP address of `www.example.com` stored from a previous request.
   - **OS Cache**: If not in the browser cache, the operating system’s DNS cache is checked.
   - **Router Cache**: The router may also have a cached entry for `example.com`.
   - **ISP DNS Lookup**: If none of these caches have the IP address, the DNS resolver (usually provided by the Internet Service Provider) is queried to resolve `www.example.com` into an IP address.
   - **Root DNS Servers**: If the ISP's DNS resolver doesn't have the IP, it asks one of the root DNS servers, which direct the query to the appropriate **Top-Level Domain (TLD)** DNS server (like `.com`).
   - **Authoritative DNS Server**: The TLD server points to the authoritative DNS server for `example.com`, which provides the IP address of the server hosting the website.

### 2. **TCP Connection Setup**
   - The browser now knows the IP address of the server and establishes a **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** connection using the **three-way handshake**:
     1. **SYN**: The client (browser) sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server.
     2. **SYN-ACK**: The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledgment) packet.
     3. **ACK**: The client sends an ACK (acknowledgment) packet back to the server, establishing the connection.

### 3. **TLS/SSL Handshake (If HTTPS)**
   - If the website uses HTTPS (secure), a **TLS/SSL handshake** happens to establish a secure connection:
     1. The browser requests the server’s SSL/TLS certificate.
     2. The server sends its certificate, which the browser verifies using Certificate Authorities (CAs).
     3. Both the client and server generate a session key, used to encrypt communication.
     4. After this, all data transferred between the browser and the server is encrypted.

### 4. **HTTP Request**
   - The browser sends an **HTTP/HTTPS GET request** to the server for the webpage:
     - The request includes headers such as:
       - **Host**: Specifies the domain name (`www.example.com`).
       - **User-Agent**: Identifies the browser and operating system.
       - **Cookies**: If previously stored, the browser sends any relevant cookies to the server.
       - **Accept**: Informs the server what content types the browser can handle (HTML, CSS, etc.).
     - The request is sent over the established TCP connection.

### 5. **Server-Side Processing**
   - The web server receives the request and processes it:
     - **Web Server**: The request first reaches the web server software (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
     - **Routing**: The server decides how to handle the request based on the URL path. It may serve static files (HTML, images, etc.) or route the request to an application server (for dynamic content).
     - **Application Server**: If the page is dynamic (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js), the request is forwarded to the application logic. Databases may be queried, business logic executed, and a response (HTML, JSON, etc.) generated.
     - **Database Query (If Needed)**: If data is needed from a database (e.g., user info or posts), the application server queries the database, retrieves the data, and incorporates it into the response.

### 6. **HTTP Response**
   - The server responds to the browser’s request with an **HTTP response**:
     - **Status Code**: The response includes a status code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).
     - **Response Body**: This contains the HTML content or other requested resources.
     - **Headers**: The response headers provide additional information, like the type of content, cookies to set, and cache control.

### 7. **Rendering the Page**
   - The browser receives the response and begins to render the page:
     - **HTML Parsing**: The browser parses the HTML, building the **DOM (Document Object Model)** tree.
     - **CSS Parsing**: CSS files are fetched and parsed to apply styles.
     - **JavaScript Execution**: If JavaScript files are included, the browser fetches and executes them.
     - **Rendering**: The browser constructs the rendered page using the parsed DOM, CSS, and JavaScript.

### 8. **Resource Loading**
   - During rendering, if the HTML references external resources (CSS, images, JavaScript, fonts), the browser sends additional requests to retrieve those assets.
     - These assets may be fetched from the cache if previously loaded, or from the server.

### 9. **Displaying the Page**
   - Once all resources are loaded and the scripts have executed, the browser displays the fully rendered page to the user.

### 10. **Post-Loading Events**
   - After the page is loaded, the browser may continue performing tasks like executing JavaScript to handle user interactions, loading additional data via AJAX (for dynamic content), or updating the page in real-time.

This entire process typically happens within a fraction of a second, depending on factors like network speed, server performance, and the complexity of the webpage.
