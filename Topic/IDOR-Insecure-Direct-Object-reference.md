# What is IDOR?
IDOR, which stands for Insecure Direct Object Reference, is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an application exposes sensitive information or functionalities by directly referencing internal implementation objects such as files, directories, or database records.

## How Does IDOR Work?
- Object Reference: In web applications, various resources like files, user records, or data entries are typically stored with unique identifiers, such as numeric IDs.

- Lack of Access Controls: If the application fails to properly enforce access controls or validate user permissions, attackers can manipulate these identifiers to access unauthorized resources.

- Direct Access: Attackers exploit this vulnerability by directly modifying the object references in URLs, parameters, or API requests to access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions.

## Example Scenario:
Consider a web application that allows users to view their own profile information by navigating to a URL like example.com/profile?id=123. The application retrieves the user's profile based on the ID provided in the URL.

- Legitimate Access: A user accesses their profile by navigating to example.com/profile?id=123.
- IDOR Exploitation: An attacker changes the ID in the URL to access another user's profile, such as example.com/profile?id=456, bypassing any authorization checks.

## Impact of IDOR:
- Unauthorized Data Access: Attackers can access sensitive information belonging to other users, such as personal details, financial records, or private messages.

- Data Manipulation: IDOR vulnerabilities can allow attackers to modify or delete data belonging to other users, leading to data loss or corruption.

- Privilege Escalation: Attackers may exploit IDOR to escalate their privileges within the application, gaining access to administrative features or sensitive functionalities.

## Mitigating IDOR:
- Authorization Checks: Implement proper access controls and authorization checks to ensure users can only access resources they are authorized to view or modify.

- Indirect Object References: Use indirect references or mappings instead of exposing internal object identifiers directly in URLs or parameters.

- Unique Identifiers: Generate and validate unique, unpredictable identifiers for sensitive objects to make it harder for attackers to guess or manipulate them.

- Audit Trails: Maintain comprehensive audit trails to track and monitor access to sensitive resources, enabling timely detection and response to potential IDOR attacks.

## Conclusion:
IDOR vulnerabilities pose significant risks to web applications by exposing sensitive resources to unauthorized access or manipulation. By understanding how IDOR works and implementing appropriate access controls and validation mechanisms, developers can mitigate this vulnerability and protect user data from unauthorized access or misuse. Regular security assessments and updates are essential to maintaining a secure software environment.
