Managing session timeouts during lengthy scans, like in an active scan lasting around 30 minutes while the session times out every 5 minutes, requires strategies to keep the session alive. Here’s how to handle this situation effectively:

### 1. **Automatic Session Management**
   - **Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP Session Handling Rules:** Most modern scanning tools allow you to define session handling rules.
      - Configure the tool to automatically re-authenticate when the session expires. 
      - For Burp Suite, go to **Project Options > Sessions** and add session handling rules that check for session expiry and initiate a re-login if the session token becomes invalid.
   - **Credential Replay:** Enable automatic re-authentication by setting up a request (like a login request) that replays the credentials whenever the session token is invalidated.

### 2. **Keep-Alive Requests**
   - **Heartbeat Requests:** Some applications allow non-intrusive "keep-alive" requests to reset the session timer. You can automate periodic heartbeat requests using scripting to keep the session active.
   - **Periodic Accessing of Session-Critical Pages:** Access a specific page on the application periodically to refresh the session.

### 3. **Token Renewal Automation**
   - **Dynamic Token Extraction:** Tools like Burp or ZAP can dynamically extract session tokens from responses.
      - Use a regex pattern to identify and capture new session tokens.
      - Store and reuse the refreshed token in the Authorization headers or cookies.
   - **Scripted Re-Login:** Write a custom script to authenticate, extract the session token, and inject it into requests if the tool doesn't support your application’s login flow directly.

### 4. **API-Based Authentication**
   - **Use API Tokens Instead of Sessions:** For applications supporting token-based authentication (like JWT or OAuth), use long-lived tokens instead of session cookies to avoid frequent re-authentication.
   - **Refresh Token Flow:** Some applications support refresh tokens that can extend the session automatically. Configure your tool to obtain a new access token using the refresh token flow as needed.

### 5. **Adjusting Session Timeout (If Possible)**
   - **Temporary Session Timeout Increase:** If you have admin access to the application, increasing the session timeout during the scan is an option.
   - **Developer Coordination:** Work with developers or administrators to extend the session timeout for testing purposes or whitelist your scanning IP for a longer session period.

Combining automated re-authentication with session handling rules is generally effective for most scanning scenarios.
