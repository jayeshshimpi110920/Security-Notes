## Cookies :
Cookies are small pieces of data stored on a user's device by a web browser while browsing a website. They are designed to hold a modest amount of data specific to a particular client and website, and they can be accessed either by the web server or the client device.

### **Details of Cookies**
- **Definition**: Cookies are text files containing name-value pairs.
- **Purpose**: They are used to remember information about the user or preferences for subsequent visits.
- **Storage Location**: Cookies are stored in the user's web browser directory or subfolders.

### **Parameters in Cookies**
Cookies contain the following attributes:

1. **Name**: The name of the cookie (a key to identify it).
2. **Value**: The associated value with the cookie's name (e.g., a session identifier).
3. **Domain**: Specifies the domain the cookie is associated with (e.g., `.example.com`).
4. **Path**: Indicates the path within the domain where the cookie is valid.
5. **Expires/Max-Age**: Defines the cookie's lifespan. If not set, the cookie is a session cookie (deleted when the browser is closed).
6. **Secure**: Ensures the cookie is sent over secure HTTPS connections only.
7. **HttpOnly**: Prevents the cookie from being accessed via JavaScript, adding a layer of security.
8. **SameSite**: Controls whether the cookie is sent with cross-site requests (options: `Strict`, `Lax`, or `None`).
9. **Priority**: Indicates the importance of the cookie (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`).

1. **Session Cookies**:
   - Temporary cookies stored in the browser's memory and deleted when the browser is closed.
   - Used for session tracking (e.g., maintaining login status).

2. **Persistent Cookies**:
   - Stored on the user's device for a specified duration, as defined by the `Expires` or `Max-Age` attribute.
   - Used for remembering preferences or login credentials.

3. **First-Party Cookies**:
   - Set by the website the user is visiting.
   - Used for functionality and user preferences.

4. **Third-Party Cookies**:
   - Set by domains other than the one the user is visiting.
   - Commonly used for tracking, advertising, and analytics.

5. **Secure Cookies**:
   - Transmitted over HTTPS only.
   - Adds security to sensitive data.

6. **HttpOnly Cookies**:
   - Cannot be accessed via JavaScript.
   - Used to mitigate XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.

### **Disadvantages of Cookies**
1. **Privacy Concerns**:
   - Can be used to track user behavior without explicit consent (third-party cookies).
2. **Security Risks**:
   - Vulnerable to theft (cookie hijacking) or misuse (e.g., XSS attacks).
3. **Data Limitations**:
   - Cookies have a size limit (usually 4KB), which restricts the amount of data that can be stored.
4. **Dependency on Browser**:
   - Users can delete or block cookies, disrupting functionality.
5. **Regulatory Compliance**:
   - Websites must adhere to laws like GDPR, requiring explicit consent for certain cookies.
