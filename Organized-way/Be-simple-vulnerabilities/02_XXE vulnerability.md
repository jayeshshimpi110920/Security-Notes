* hacker identifies application with weakly configured XML parser & send XML requsst.
* XML procesor retrived malicious external entity within DTD(document type declaration)
* XML processor validate DTD and resolve malicious external entity.
* XML request is parsed
* sensitive data is shared with hacker.

---

its a security flaw that occurs when XML parser process external entities within XML input.

**impact** - attacker exploit this to access sensitive files/perform SSRF or execute malicious action on server.

**prevention** -
* disable external entities - comfigure XML parser to dosable DTD and external entity processing
* Use secure libraries - that do not enable external entity processing by default.
* i/p validation/ whitelisting.
