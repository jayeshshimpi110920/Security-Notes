## Privilege Escalation
Privilege escalation is a type of security exploit in which an attacker gains elevated access to resources that are typically restricted. There are two main types:

### 1. **Vertical Privilege Escalation**
   - **Definition**: The attacker gains higher-level privileges than they should have, such as moving from a regular user to an admin.
   - **Example**: Accessing admin-only features by manipulating roles or bypassing access control.

### 2. **Horizontal Privilege Escalation**
   - **Definition**: The attacker remains at the same privilege level but accesses resources or data belonging to other users.
   - **Example**: Accessing another user’s account or data without permission.

### Key Differences
   - **Level of Access**: Vertical targets higher privileges (e.g., admin rights), while horizontal targets peer resources (e.g., another user’s account).
   - **Intent**: Vertical often aims at control over the system, while horizontal focuses on unauthorized data access.

### Impact of Both
   - **Vertical**: Can lead to full system control, critical data exposure, and potential manipulation of system settings.
   - **Horizontal**: Leads to privacy violations, unauthorized data access, and compromised user accounts.

### Prevention of Privilege Escalation
   - **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensure that users only have permissions necessary for their role.
   - **Use Least Privilege Principle**: Grant minimal privileges to users, reducing the risk of escalation.
   - **Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Strengthens authentication for higher-privileged accounts.
   - **Conduct Regular Security Audits**: Identify permission inconsistencies and potential access control vulnerabilities.

### How to Find Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities
#### Manual Testing
   - **Role Manipulation**: Test if role-based access restrictions can be bypassed by altering parameters (e.g., changing `role=user` to `role=admin`).
   - **Access Unauthorized Endpoints**: Try accessing sensitive features or data by direct URL or parameter changes to see if access controls are enforced.
   - **Check Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Review if permissions align with user roles and don’t provide more access than necessary.

#### Tools for Automated Testing
   - **Burp Suite**: Repeater and Intruder tools can modify requests to test unauthorized access to endpoints or elevate privileges.
   - **OWASP ZAP**: Scans for access control vulnerabilities by attempting unauthorized access to resources.
   - **Postman**: Useful for testing API endpoints by manipulating tokens, IDs, and roles to check for privilege enforcement.

By carefully implementing secure access controls and performing regular tests, organizations can mitigate the risks of privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
