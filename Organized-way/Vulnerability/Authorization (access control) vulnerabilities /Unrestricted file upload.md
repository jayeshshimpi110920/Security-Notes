**Unrestricted File Upload** vulnerabilities occur when an application fails to validate or restrict file uploads, allowing attackers to upload malicious files that can lead to various attacks like remote code execution, malware injection, and data exfiltration.

### Impacts of Unrestricted File Upload
1. **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: Attackers can upload executable files, which, if processed by the server, allow them to execute arbitrary commands, potentially taking control of the system.
2. **Malware Injection**: Malicious files, such as scripts or viruses, can be uploaded and distributed to other users, infecting their devices.
3. **File Overwriting or Defacement**: Attackers may upload files with names that match existing files, potentially altering or deleting critical content.
4. **Access to Sensitive Data**: Through file uploads, attackers may access or create backdoors to retrieve sensitive information from the server.

### How to Prevent Unrestricted File Uploads
1. **File Type and Extension Validation**:
   - Allow only specific file types (e.g., images like `.jpg`, `.png`) and use server-side validation to reject disallowed extensions.
   - Validate file types by checking MIME types, not just extensions, to avoid bypasses with renamed files.

2. **Limit File Execution**:
   - Store uploaded files outside the web root to prevent direct access and execution.
   - Use restrictive permissions so uploaded files cannot execute on the server.

3. **File Content Validation**:
   - Scan file contents for malicious scripts using antivirus or malware detection tools before storing.
   - Check image files using image libraries (like PIL in Python) to confirm they match the expected format.

4. **Rename Files**:
   - Assign unique filenames to avoid potential overwriting and limit attackers’ ability to use known paths.

5. **Restrict File Size and Count**:
   - Limit upload size to prevent DoS attacks or storage abuse.
   - Enforce user quotas to manage the amount of uploaded data.

### How to Find Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerabilities

#### Manual Testing
1. **Upload File with Executable Extensions**: Test by uploading files with potentially dangerous extensions (`.php`, `.exe`, `.jsp`) and check if the application accepts them.
2. **Check MIME Type Bypasses**: Change the MIME type in the upload request (e.g., set an executable file to `image/png`) and observe if the application validates based on MIME or extension.
3. **Access Uploaded Files Directly**: If files are uploaded within the web root, attempt to access the uploaded files by direct URL to see if they can be executed or accessed.
4. **Test for Script Injection**: Upload files with embedded scripts (e.g., in `.html` or `.svg` files) and observe if the server executes or processes the scripts.

#### Using Automated Tools
1. **Burp Suite**:
   - Use Burp’s Repeater to upload different types of files and observe server responses.
   - Burp Scanner can help detect if files are stored in accessible directories.
2. **OWASP ZAP**:
   - ZAP’s fuzzing tool allows you to test file uploads with different extensions and file contents, detecting improper validation and storage.
3. **Metasploit**:
   - For more advanced testing, Metasploit can simulate file upload attacks in safe environments to test potential impacts.
4. **Postman**:
   - Use Postman to test API endpoints for file uploads, altering MIME types and file content to test for validation and restrictions.

### Summary
Unrestricted file uploads can result in serious security risks, including remote code execution and malware infection. Proper file validation, storage outside the web root, content scanning, and execution restriction are critical preventive measures. Both manual testing (altering file types, extensions, MIME types) and automated tools (like Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP) are effective in identifying these vulnerabilities.
