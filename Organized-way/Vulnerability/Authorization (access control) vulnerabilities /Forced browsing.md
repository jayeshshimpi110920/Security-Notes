## Forced Browsing
An attacker directly accesses restricted pages or files by guessing URLs, without any server-side checks.
**Example:** Accessing /admin or /config by guessing these paths, if access control isn’t enforced.

---
Force browsing, also known as forced browsing or direct object reference manipulation, is a web security vulnerability where an attacker manually tries to access unauthorized resources, files, or directories by altering URLs. The attacker “browses” to parts of a website that are not intended for their access level, like restricted directories, files, admin pages, or resources meant for other users.

### How Force Browsing Works
In a force browsing attack, the attacker typically modifies URLs or file paths in an attempt to reach resources directly, bypassing any front-end access controls or authentication mechanisms. For example, they might:
- Change the URL from `http://example.com/user/1234/profile` to `http://example.com/admin/settings`
- Attempt to access files like `/admin`, `/backup`, `/config`, or `/users`
- Increment or decrement numeric IDs in URLs to view other users’ profiles or records.

### Common Force Browsing Targets
1. **Administrative Pages**: Attackers may attempt to reach admin interfaces not meant for regular users (e.g., `/admin`, `/control-panel`).
2. **Sensitive Files and Directories**: Files like `backup.zip`, `config.json`, `.env`, or `/logs` often contain sensitive information.
3. **User Resources**: By manipulating user-specific resources like `/user/1234`, attackers may try accessing other users' data (e.g., `/user/1235`).

### Impact of Force Browsing
- **Data Exposure**: Unauthorized access to sensitive user or system data, such as personal information or configuration settings.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Gaining access to administrative functions that allow modifying or deleting data.
- **Data Tampering**: Unauthorized modification or deletion of information.
- **Security and Privacy Violations**: Breaches of confidentiality and integrity in multi-user applications.

### How to Prevent Force Browsing
1. **Implement Strong Access Control**:
   - Apply server-side checks to ensure users can only access resources they’re authorized for.
   - Validate access control at the backend, not just the frontend.
   
2. **Avoid Direct Object References in URLs**:
   - Replace direct references (like user IDs) with indirect references (e.g., tokens or hashed IDs) that are hard to guess.
   
3. **Use Secure Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms**:
   - Enforce strict session handling and authentication checks on each resource request.
   
4. **Directory Indexing and Resource Protection**:
   - Disable directory listing on the server to prevent users from seeing lists of files in directories.
   - Protect sensitive files and directories with authentication and ensure they are not accessible to unauthorized users.

5. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Define user roles and restrict access based on roles so that different users have access only to permitted areas.

### How to Find Force Browsing Vulnerabilities

#### 1. **Manual Testing**
   - **Direct URL Manipulation**: Try modifying URL parameters (like user IDs, filenames, or folder paths) to see if unauthorized access is possible.
   - **Incrementing or Decrementing IDs**: If the application uses sequential IDs for resources, try increasing or decreasing them to test access to other users' data.
   - **Directory and File Guessing**: Attempt common folder and file names, such as `/admin`, `/config`, `/backup.zip`, `/logs`, or user-accessible files in `/user/[id]/`.

#### 2. **Automated Tools**
   - **Burp Suite**: Burp’s Intruder tool is useful for automating force browsing by brute-forcing IDs or file paths. Burp’s content discovery features (like Burp’s BApp - Content Discovery) also help in identifying hidden or unprotected directories.
   - **OWASP ZAP**: ZAP’s forced browsing or "Forced Browse" feature can help locate accessible resources by brute-forcing directories and files.
   - **Dirbuster and Gobuster**: These tools are specifically designed for directory and file brute-forcing and can help identify accessible paths not linked on a web page.

#### 3. **Common Payloads and Techniques**
   - **ID Manipulation**: Changing `/user/1000` to `/user/1001`, `/user/1002`, etc., to check if they’re accessible.
   - **Common Directory/File Names**: Trying paths like `/admin`, `/secret`, `/private`, `/logs`, `/backup`, and variations (e.g., `/backup.zip`).
   - **Enumeration with Wordlists**: Using wordlists to try various directory and file names with tools like Gobuster.

### Summary of Detection Techniques
- **Manual URL Modification**: Adjust URL parameters, paths, or IDs.
- **Automated Brute-forcing**: Use tools like Burp, ZAP, Dirbuster, or Gobuster with wordlists.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Check logs for abnormal access patterns, such as attempts to access restricted directories or files.

Force browsing vulnerabilities demonstrate the need for robust access controls and secure resource handling to ensure that only authorized users can access specific resources.
