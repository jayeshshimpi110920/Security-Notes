### **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**

#### **1. What is IDOR?**
IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) is a type of access control vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate input parameters to gain unauthorized access to resources, such as files, database records, or other objects that should be restricted. This happens when the application exposes references to internal objects (e.g., database IDs or filenames) in URLs or form parameters without proper authorization checks.

#### **2. How Does IDOR Work?**
In an IDOR vulnerability, the application might allow users to directly access resources using references such as:
- **URLs**: `https://example.com/user/12345/profile`
- **Parameters**: `GET /download?file_id=7890`

If proper authorization checks are not in place, an attacker could modify these values to access other users’ resources, for example:
- Changing `12345` to another user’s ID in the URL.
- Changing `file_id` to download files they should not have access to.

#### **3. Real-World Example of IDOR**
- **User Profiles**: A user is logged in and can view their profile via `https://example.com/profile?id=123`. If the application does not validate that `id=123` belongs to the logged-in user, the attacker could change `id=124` to view another user’s profile.
- **File Access**: A file download link like `https://example.com/download?file_id=7890` might be manipulated to download unauthorized files by changing `file_id`.

#### **4. Possible Vulnerabilities Arising from IDOR**
- **Unauthorized Data Access**: Attackers can view or modify sensitive data of other users (e.g., personal information, financial records).
- **File Disclosure**: Attackers might gain access to sensitive files or documents.
- **Privilege Escalation**: An attacker may elevate privileges by accessing or manipulating objects they shouldn’t control.

#### **5. How to Find IDOR Vulnerabilities**
- **Manual Testing**:
  - Identify parameters that reference objects (IDs, file names).
  - Manipulate these references (e.g., change numbers in URLs, form data).
  - Check if unauthorized access is granted without proper validation.
  
- **Use Browser Developer Tools**:
  - Inspect URLs, form fields, and network requests to identify object references.
  - Modify values to see if the server grants access to unauthorized data.

- **Tools**:
  - **Burp Suite**: Intercept and modify requests to manipulate object references and test for access control issues.
  - **OWASP ZAP**: Automate scanning and look for IDOR by analyzing and modifying object references.
  - **Fuzzing**: Use automated fuzzing tools to identify object references and modify them systematically.

#### **6. Impact of IDOR Vulnerabilities**
- **Data Breaches**: Attackers can gain access to sensitive user information like personal data, financial records, or private files.
- **Unauthorized Actions**: Attackers might perform unauthorized actions such as editing or deleting data belonging to other users.
- **Compliance Violations**: Exposing sensitive data via IDOR could lead to violations of data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

#### **7. How to Prevent IDOR Vulnerabilities**
- **Use Proper Authorization Controls**: Ensure that authorization checks are in place to verify that a user is authorized to access or manipulate an object.
- **Avoid Exposing Object References in URLs**: Use indirect references (e.g., tokens or hashed values) instead of exposing direct identifiers like IDs or filenames in URLs.
- **Apply Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC)**: Ensure that users can only access resources that correspond to their roles and permissions.
- **Input Validation**: Validate all incoming requests to ensure they are properly authenticated and authorized before granting access.
- **Object Ownership Verification**: Always verify that the user requesting access to a resource is the legitimate owner of the resource.

#### **8. IDOR Detection with Tools**
- **Burp Suite**:
  - Use the Intruder feature to systematically modify object references and check for access control flaws.
  - Analyze response codes, file contents, or error messages when parameters are altered.
  
- **OWASP ZAP**: 
  - Run automated scans for access control issues and test parameters to detect IDOR.
  - Look for vulnerabilities in object references and URL parameters.

#### **9. Example of Preventing IDOR**
Instead of directly using object references like `user_id=123`, use an indirect reference such as a securely generated token:
```plaintext
https://example.com/profile?token=xyz123
```
This token should be validated server-side to map back to the actual object while ensuring the user has permission to access it.

By implementing strong access controls and validating all references to internal objects, IDOR vulnerabilities can be mitigated, protecting sensitive data and maintaining system security.
