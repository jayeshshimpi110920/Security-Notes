## Stored XSS (Persistent XSS)

**Behavior**: In Stored XSS, the malicious script is stored on the server (e.g., in a database) and gets executed when users visit a page that loads the data.

**Timing**: The payload may not execute immediately after being injected. It depends on when the stored data is displayed on the affected page.

**Example**: If you inject the script in a comment field, it wonâ€™t execute right away. It will only execute when the page displaying the comments is loaded or refreshed.


**Test Scenario**:

Input a malicious script into a form (e.g., comment, profile description).

Navigate to the page where that input is reflected to see if the script is executed.

**Visibility**: The script only executes when another user or the same user loads the page where the malicious input is displayed.
