**Credential stuffing** is a type of attack where attackers use large collections of username-password pairs, typically obtained from previous data breaches, to attempt logging into various accounts on a website. Since many people reuse passwords across multiple sites, attackers exploit this behavior to gain unauthorized access.

### **How Credential Stuffing Works**
1. **Data Breach**: Attackers obtain a list of credentials (username/email and password) from a data breach.
2. **Automated Login Attempts**: Using automated tools (like Hydra, Burp Suite, or custom scripts), attackers try logging into various websites with those credentials.
3. **Successful Logins**: If users have reused the same credentials across sites, attackers can successfully log in to those accounts.
4. **Exploitation**: Once access is gained, attackers can perform malicious actions like data theft, financial fraud, or account takeover.

### **Difference Between Credential Stuffing and Brute-Force Attacks**
- **Credential Stuffing** uses **known username-password combinations** obtained from previous breaches.
- **Brute-Force** involves guessing passwords by systematically trying many possible combinations.

### **How to Perform Credential Stuffing (Ethically)**

Before trying credential stuffing, ensure you are **authorized** to do so. It’s illegal to use this technique on systems where you do not have explicit permission.

#### **Tools for Credential Stuffing**

1. **Hydra**
   Hydra can be used for credential stuffing by providing a list of known username-password combinations.
   
   **Command**:
   ```bash
   hydra -C credentials.txt <protocol>://<target-url> <form>
   ```

   - `-C credentials.txt`: This option allows you to use a combo list of `username:password` pairs.
   - Example of `credentials.txt` file:
     ```text
     admin:password123
     user1:qwerty
     john.doe:letmein
     ```

   - Full example:
     ```bash
     hydra -C credentials.txt http-post-form "/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Invalid credentials" -V
     ```

2. **Burp Suite** (Professional Edition)
   Burp Suite has a tool called **Intruder**, which can be used for credential stuffing.

   **Steps**:
   - Capture the login request with Burp Suite Proxy.
   - Send the request to Intruder.
   - Set the **payload positions** for the username and password fields.
   - Use a list of **username:password** pairs as payloads.
   - Analyze the responses to find successful login attempts.

3. **Sentry MBA** (Credential Stuffing Tool)
   Sentry MBA is designed for credential stuffing attacks, using combos (username:password lists) to attempt logins.

   **Steps**:
   - Configure a "config" file for the target website.
   - Provide a list of credential combos (username:password).
   - Start the attack and review results for successful logins.

4. **Snipr** and **STORM**
   These are tools explicitly designed for credential stuffing on websites with login forms.

### **How to Detect and Defend Against Credential Stuffing**

1. **Rate Limiting**:
   Limit the number of login attempts from a single IP address or account to prevent rapid automated login attempts.

2. **CAPTCHA**:
   Implement CAPTCHAs after several failed login attempts to block bots from continuing.

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   Require MFA (such as SMS or an authenticator app) to prevent attackers from accessing accounts even if they have the correct credentials.

4. **IP Blacklisting**:
   Block IP addresses from regions where you don't expect legitimate login activity, especially if they're attempting many logins.

5. **Monitor Failed Login Attempts**:
   Track patterns of failed login attempts. A high number of failures could indicate a credential stuffing attack.

6. **Password Hygiene**:
   Encourage users to use unique passwords for every site and regularly check for their credentials in breach databases like **Have I Been Pwned**.

### **Ethical Consideration**:
Credential stuffing is often illegal if performed without permission. It’s considered a malicious attack when done on unauthorized sites. You should only use it on systems where you have **explicit authorization**, such as during a **penetration test** or for bug bounties. Always follow legal and ethical guidelines when testing security systems.

By using these tools and techniques ethically, you can identify weaknesses in authentication systems and help mitigate risks related to reused or compromised credentials.
