Ensuring secure password storage is essential to prevent attackers from retrieving or cracking user passwords in case of a data breach. Below are the best practices and techniques to securely store passwords:

### **1. Use Strong Hashing Algorithms**

Passwords should **never** be stored in plain text. Instead, they should be **hashed** using secure cryptographic algorithms. A cryptographic hash is a one-way function that converts input data (like a password) into a fixed-size string of characters.

#### **Recommended Hashing Algorithms**:
- **bcrypt**: A slow, adaptive hashing function designed specifically for password hashing. Its work factor (cost) can be adjusted to make it slower as hardware improves.
- **Argon2**: Winner of the Password Hashing Competition (PHC), it's highly recommended for modern password hashing due to its flexibility and security features.
- **PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2)**: A secure hashing function that includes a configurable number of iterations to increase computation time.
- **scrypt**: Another strong option, similar to bcrypt, but it’s designed to be memory-intensive to defend against hardware-based attacks (like GPUs and ASICs).

**Never** use old or weak algorithms like MD5 or SHA-1 for password hashing, as they are vulnerable to collisions and brute-force attacks.

### **2. Add Salt to Passwords**

A **salt** is a random string that is added to the password before hashing to ensure that even if two users have the same password, their hashed values will be different. Salting defends against **rainbow table attacks**, where attackers use precomputed hash tables to crack passwords.

- Salts should be **unique** for each password.
- Salts should be **random** and **long enough** (e.g., 16-32 bytes).
- Salts should be **stored alongside the hash**, as they are not sensitive data on their own.

**Example**:
If the password is `password123`, and the salt is `G5vJx8`, the final string to hash would be `password123G5vJx8`.

### **3. Peppering Passwords (Optional)**

**Peppering** adds another layer of security by appending a secret value, known only to the server, to the password before hashing. Unlike salts, peppers are not stored in the database but in the server configuration.

- A **pepper** is usually a global constant shared across all passwords in the system.
- It's kept secret and can add a layer of protection in case the database is compromised but not the server.

### **4. Use Secure Password Policy**

Implement a password policy that encourages users to create **strong passwords**:
- **Minimum length**: At least 8-12 characters.
- **Complexity**: Mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Prevent common passwords**: Block passwords from known breaches or weak passwords (e.g., “password123”, “admin”, etc.).
- **Rate Limiting**: After multiple failed login attempts, introduce a delay or lock the account temporarily to prevent brute-force attacks.

### **5. Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

Even with secure password storage, using **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** adds an additional layer of protection. MFA requires users to provide two or more verification factors (e.g., a password and an OTP from an authenticator app).

### **6. Secure Password Transmission**

Ensure that passwords are transmitted securely by using **HTTPS (SSL/TLS)** to encrypt communication between the client (browser) and the server. Never send passwords over unencrypted channels, as they could be intercepted by attackers.

### **7. Perform Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing**

Regularly audit your systems to ensure that passwords are being stored securely and no misconfigurations are present. Penetration testing should also include checking for password storage vulnerabilities.

### **8. Protect Against Timing Attacks**

When checking if a user-provided password matches the stored hash, ensure that the comparison function takes a constant amount of time regardless of whether the passwords match or not. This prevents **timing attacks**, where attackers can infer information based on how long the system takes to compare passwords.

Use libraries that perform **constant-time comparison** to avoid leaking timing information.

### **9. Avoid Reversible Encryption**

Do not store passwords using **reversible encryption**. Even if the encryption keys are kept secret, if they are compromised, all stored passwords can be recovered. Always use **one-way hashing** algorithms instead.

### **10. Use Secure Library Implementations**

Rely on well-tested libraries and frameworks for password hashing and storage, rather than implementing your own. Some of the popular libraries include:
- **bcrypt**:
  - Python: `bcrypt` library
  - Node.js: `bcrypt` module
  - Java: `BCryptPasswordEncoder` in Spring Security
- **Argon2**:
  - Python: `argon2-cffi`
  - Node.js: `argon2` module
- **PBKDF2**:
  - Python: `hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac()`
  - Node.js: `crypto.pbkdf2()`

### **11. Educate Users on Password Hygiene**

Encourage users to follow good password management practices:
- Use **password managers** to store and generate complex, unique passwords.
- Regularly update passwords, especially if a breach occurs.
- Avoid reusing passwords across multiple sites and services.

### **Example of Secure Password Storage Flow**

1. **User registration**:
   - The user creates an account with a password.
   - A **salt** is generated for the password.
   - The salt and the password are concatenated and passed through a **strong hash function** (e.g., bcrypt).
   - The resulting hash and the salt are stored in the database.

2. **User login**:
   - The user enters their password.
   - The stored salt is retrieved from the database.
   - The password and the salt are concatenated and hashed again.
   - The resulting hash is compared to the stored hash. If they match, the user is authenticated.

### **Conclusion**

To ensure password storage is secure, always hash passwords using strong, slow algorithms (like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2), use unique salts for each password, enforce strong password policies, and add extra layers of security like MFA. By following these practices, even if a database is breached, the passwords will be much more difficult for attackers to crack.

## Finding's
---
To find insecure password vulnerabilities, you can either test manually or use automated tools. Here's how:

### **Manual Testing:**

1. **Weak Password Policy:**
   - **Inspect registration forms**: Check if the system enforces strong password policies (e.g., minimum length, complexity, special characters).
   - **Password Reuse**: Test if the system allows users to reuse old passwords after resetting.
   - **Password Length**: Test by entering short passwords like "1234" to see if the system accepts weak passwords.
   
2. **Plaintext Password Storage:**
   - **Reset Password Email**: Request a password reset and check the email content. If it contains the old password, it's a sign of insecure password storage.
   - **Password Exposure in Logs**: Check application error logs (if accessible) to see if passwords are logged in plaintext.

3. **Password Transmission (Cleartext over HTTP):**
   - **Sniff Network Traffic**: Use tools like **Wireshark** to intercept network traffic. If login credentials are transmitted over HTTP (unencrypted), this is a vulnerability.

4. **Default Passwords**: 
   - **Test default credentials**: Check if the system uses common or default credentials (like admin/admin) without forcing a change on the first login.

5. **Brute-Force Protection**:
   - **Multiple Attempts**: Try repeatedly guessing the password to check if there are rate limits or CAPTCHA after several failed attempts.

### **Tools for Automated Testing:**

1. **Burp Suite**:
   - Use **Intruder** to test weak password policies or brute-force attack using a wordlist.
   - Look for improper password storage and password length policy through **passive scanning**.

2. **OWASP ZAP**:
   - Use ZAP to scan for insecure password policies and weak password storage configurations during a web application security test.

3. **Nessus**:
   - Use Nessus to check for systems with default credentials, weak password policies, or password storage issues.

4. **Hydra or Medusa**:
   - For brute-force testing on login forms, you can use Hydra or Medusa with a dictionary to check for weak passwords.

By combining manual inspection and tool-assisted testing, you can uncover insecure password vulnerabilities more comprehensively.
