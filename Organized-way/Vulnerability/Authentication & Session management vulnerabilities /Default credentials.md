**Default credentials** are the factory-set usernames and passwords that come pre-configured on devices, software, and applications. These credentials are meant to be changed during setup, but many users fail to update them, leaving systems vulnerable to attacks. **Default credentials** are widely known, often listed in product documentation, or can be easily found online.

Attackers often use these default credentials to gain unauthorized access to systems that haven't had their login credentials updated.

### **Common Default Credentials**

Many devices, such as routers, IoT devices, databases, and web applications, have default credentials. Here's a list of some common default usernames and passwords:

| **Device/Software**       | **Default Username** | **Default Password**  |
|---------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Cisco Routers              | `admin`              | `admin` or `cisco`    |
| D-Link Routers             | `admin`              | `admin`               |
| TP-Link Routers            | `admin`              | `admin`               |
| MySQL                      | `root`               | (no password)         |
| PostgreSQL                 | `postgres`           | `postgres`            |
| Tomcat                     | `admin`              | `admin`               |
| Jenkins                    | `admin`              | `admin`               |
| Wordpress                  | `admin`              | `admin`               |
| Webmin                     | `admin`              | `admin`               |
| Oracle Database            | `system`             | `manager`             |
| IBM DB2                    | `db2admin`           | `db2admin`            |
| phpMyAdmin                 | `root`               | `root`                |

**Note**: Default credentials are specific to the product and version, so always refer to the official documentation of the specific version you’re testing.

### **How Attackers Use Default Credentials**

Attackers typically use **default credentials** in the following scenarios:

1. **Mass Scanning**: Attackers scan large ranges of IP addresses for open services (e.g., SSH, HTTP, MySQL) and attempt to log in using default credentials.
   
2. **IoT Devices**: Many IoT devices have weak or unchanged default credentials, making them prime targets for attackers who can take control of these devices for malicious purposes (e.g., launching DDoS attacks).

3. **Brute-Force Tools**: Tools like Hydra and Medusa can be configured to try known default credentials on common services. Attackers don't have to guess; they simply try known defaults.

### **How to Find Systems Using Default Credentials**

#### 1. **Nmap Default Script Scans**
Nmap includes some scripts that can check for default credentials on various services like FTP, MySQL, and HTTP.

**Example Nmap Command**:
```bash
nmap --script http-default-accounts -p80 <target-ip>
```

This Nmap command scans for HTTP services on port 80 and checks if there are any known default accounts present on the system.

#### 2. **Hydra for Default Credentials**
Hydra can be used to test default credentials for services like SSH, HTTP login, or databases.

**Example Command**:
```bash
hydra -l admin -p admin <target-ip> http-get /admin
```

- `-l admin`: Uses the default username `admin`.
- `-p admin`: Tries the default password `admin`.
- `http-get /admin`: Attempts the login on the `/admin` page of the HTTP service.

#### 3. **Metasploit Default Credentials Scanner**
Metasploit also has modules for scanning for default credentials on various services.

**Example Command**:
```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_login
set RHOSTS <target-ip>
set USERNAME admin
set PASSWORD admin
run
```

This scans an HTTP login form on the target with the default `admin:admin` credentials.

### **How to Mitigate Default Credential Risks**

1. **Change Default Credentials**: As a best practice, always change the default credentials during the initial setup of any system, device, or service.

2. **Use Strong Passwords**: Replace default credentials with strong, complex passwords that are unique to each system.

3. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: For critical systems, use MFA to add an extra layer of protection beyond just a username and password.

4. **Restrict Access**: Limit access to administrative interfaces like web-based dashboards or SSH to trusted IP addresses or internal networks.

5. **Disable Unnecessary Services**: Disable services that you don’t need. Many services that come with default credentials are not necessary and increase your attack surface.

6. **Regular Audits**: Periodically scan your network for devices and services that might still be using default credentials. Tools like Nmap and Nessus can help with this.

7. **Update Firmware/Software**: Many device manufacturers release firmware updates to patch security vulnerabilities, including those related to default credentials.

### **Ethical Hacking and Default Credentials**

When performing **penetration testing** or **security assessments**, checking for default credentials is a crucial step. Here's how you might approach this:

1. **Identify Services**: Use tools like Nmap to identify running services (HTTP, SSH, MySQL, etc.) on the target system.
2. **Look Up Defaults**: Refer to vendor documentation, security databases (like CIRT.net), or resources like GitHub lists of default credentials.
3. **Test the Credentials**: Use tools like Hydra, Medusa, or even manual attempts to log in with known default credentials.

**Be sure to have permission** when conducting tests. Unapproved scanning and testing can be illegal.

### **Conclusion**
Default credentials are a well-known security weakness. Attackers often take advantage of misconfigured or unpatched systems that still have default usernames and passwords. Regularly updating credentials, auditing systems, and implementing additional security controls like MFA are key to mitigating these risks.
