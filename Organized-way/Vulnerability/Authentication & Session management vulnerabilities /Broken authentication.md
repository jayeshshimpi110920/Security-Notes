## Broken Authentication -
It is a common security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can exploit flaws in the authentication mechanisms of a system to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
> what will come in our mind when its Broken Authentication (Authentication - login page) ---there is flaw in authentication mechanisms---

This can be happen due to several reason;
1) ***Weak Password Policies***:
* Allowing short or simple passwords.
* Lack of enforcement for password complexity (e.g., no special characters or numbers).
* No account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts, leading to brute-force attacks.

2) ***Credential Stuffing:***
* Attackers use previously breached username-password pairs from other websites to log in to accounts on the targeted website. This succeeds if users reuse passwords across different services.

3) ***Session Management Issues***:
* Session IDs are predictable or easily guessable, allowing attackers to hijack valid sessions.
*Failure to invalidate sessions after logout or inactivity.
*Session IDs stored in URLs, exposing them to potential interception.

4) ***Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):***
* Relying only on username and password for authentication. Without MFA, an attacker can easily gain access if they have stolen or guessed credentials.

5) ***Exposed Authentication Credentials:***

* Storing passwords in plaintext or weakly hashed (e.g., using outdated hashing algorithms like MD5 or SHA-1).
* Insecure transmission of credentials (e.g., over HTTP instead of HTTPS).
  
6) ***Forgot Password or Account Recovery Flaws:***

* Insecure password reset mechanisms that allow attackers to reset passwords using known information (like email addresses or security questions).
* Sending reset tokens via insecure methods or exposing them in URLs.
---------------------------
### Consequences of Broken Authentication:
- **Account Takeover**: Attackers can gain control of user accounts, leading to data breaches, fraudulent transactions, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Attackers may gain access to higher-privileged accounts (e.g., admin accounts) by exploiting weak authentication controls.
- **Data Theft**: Once authenticated, attackers can steal sensitive data or cause financial loss.

### How to Prevent Broken Authentication:
1. **Strong Password Policies**:
   - Enforce complex password rules (length, character variety).
   - Implement password strength checks and disallow common passwords.
   - Require periodic password changes and disallow password reuse.

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - Implement MFA for sensitive operations and login, requiring users to verify their identity using a second factor, like a phone app or hardware token.

3. **Limit Failed Login Attempts**:
   - Implement account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed login attempts.
   - Use CAPTCHAs to prevent automated login attempts (brute-force and credential stuffing).

4. **Secure Session Management**:
   - Use secure, randomly generated session IDs.
   - Implement secure cookies (with HTTPOnly, Secure, and SameSite flags) to protect against cookie theft.
   - Ensure proper session expiration and invalidation after logout or inactivity.

5. **Use Strong Password Hashing**:
   - Store passwords using strong hashing algorithms like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2.
   - Use salting to ensure that the same password does not yield the same hash.

6. **Secure Password Recovery**:
   - Implement secure methods for resetting passwords, such as using time-limited tokens sent via email.
   - Avoid easily guessable security questions and answers.

By addressing these issues, you can significantly reduce the risk of broken authentication vulnerabilities and better protect user accounts from attacks.

### Finding **Broken Authentication** vulnerabilities can be done both **manually** and using **tools**. Here's how you can approach it:

---

### **1. Manual Testing for Broken Authentication**
Manual testing involves inspecting authentication mechanisms to find flaws that could allow attackers to bypass them. Here are common areas to test:

#### **A. Weak Password Policy**
- **Try logging in with weak passwords** (e.g., "password123", "123456", "admin").
- **Check if password complexity requirements** are enforced (uppercase, lowercase, special characters, etc.).
- **Test for password reuse**: Check if the application allows setting a previously used password.

#### **B. Brute-Force Protection**
- Attempt multiple failed login attempts to see if:
  - **Account lockout** occurs after a set number of attempts.
  - CAPTCHA or any rate-limiting features are triggered.
  - If there’s no lockout, it’s vulnerable to brute-force or credential stuffing.
  
#### **C. Session Management Issues**
- **Cookie Analysis**: 
  - Inspect session cookies in the browser to see if they have the `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` attributes.
  - Check if the session cookies are **predictable** by manipulating them and observing server responses.
- **Test session expiration**:
  - Log in and wait for some time to check if the session expires.
  - Check if sessions are properly invalidated on logout by inspecting cookies after logging out.
  
#### **D. Credential Stuffing**
- **Reuse previously compromised credentials** (from a known breach) across different accounts to see if they work.
- Check if there is any **rate limiting** or **MFA** to prevent credential stuffing attacks.

#### **E. Insecure Password Recovery**
- Try to perform a **password reset** using different attack vectors:
  - Manipulate the reset token.
  - Test if old tokens can still be used to reset the password.
  - Check if answers to security questions are easily guessable or public (e.g., "What is your mother’s maiden name?").

#### **F. Missing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- Test if the application allows login using just the username and password without MFA for sensitive accounts.
- Try to bypass or disable MFA if implemented (test for weak implementations).

#### **G. User Enumeration**
- Attempt to log in or reset passwords with different usernames or email addresses and observe if the application reveals whether the account exists (e.g., "User does not exist" vs. "Incorrect password").

### **2. Tools to Find Broken Authentication Vulnerabilities**
Several automated tools can help discover broken authentication issues. Here are some useful tools:

#### **A. Burp Suite** (Community/Pro Version)
- **Brute Force Testing**: Using Burp Intruder, you can perform brute-force attacks by sending multiple login requests with different credentials.
- **Session Analysis**: Use the **HTTP history** to analyze session tokens and cookies.
- **Testing Weak Passwords**: Send login attempts with weak passwords and see if authentication is allowed.
- **Testing for Enumeration**: Inspect server responses for different login attempts and see if it leaks information about user existence.
  
#### **Steps in Burp Suite**:
- **Capture login request**: Use the Proxy feature to intercept the login request and send it to Intruder.
- **Configure payloads**: Add weak passwords, usernames, or known credentials in Intruder’s payload list.
- **Run the attack**: Run the attack and look for successful responses or lack of lockout mechanisms.

#### **B. OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)**
- **Forced Browsing & Enumeration**: Use ZAP’s Forced Browse functionality to discover unprotected resources.
- **Session Management Testing**: ZAP can intercept HTTP requests, allowing you to test session tokens for security issues.
- **Authentication Testing Add-Ons**: ZAP has plugins to check for common authentication flaws, like weak credentials and exposed sessions.

#### **C. Hydra** (Brute Force Tool)
- **Brute-force attacks**: Hydra is used to automate brute-force attacks on login forms, FTP, SSH, etc.
- **Credential stuffing**: You can use known username-password pairs to check for credential stuffing vulnerabilities.

#### **D. Nmap with NSE Scripts**
- Use Nmap’s `nse` scripts for authentication and brute-force testing:
  - **`http-brute`**: To test web applications for weak or default credentials.
  - **`ssh-brute`**: For SSH brute-forcing.
  
#### **E. Patator**
- Patator is another brute-forcing tool like Hydra but with more flexibility for different protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, SSH, etc.

### **3. Practical Example: Testing Login Page for Broken Authentication Using Burp Suite**
- **Step 1**: Set up Burp Proxy to intercept HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
- **Step 2**: Navigate to the login page and submit login requests (either with valid/invalid credentials).
- **Step 3**: Use Burp Intruder to perform a **brute-force attack** by sending multiple login attempts.
- **Step 4**: Check for any **lockout mechanisms** (e.g., does the application prevent multiple login attempts?).
- **Step 5**: Analyze the **session management**:
  - Ensure session cookies are marked with `Secure` and `HttpOnly`.
  - Verify session expiration after logging out or idle time.
