### SQL Injection (SQLi) Vulnerability

**SQL Injection (SQLi)** is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to interfere with the queries an application makes to its database. It occurs when an application improperly sanitizes user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This can lead to unauthorized access to data, data modification, and, in severe cases, complete control over the database server.

> SQL Injection (SQLi) is a vulnerability where an attacker manipulates a web application's SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code into input fields (e.g., login forms, search boxes). This allows attackers to access, modify, or delete database data and, in severe cases, control the database server.

---

### Impact of SQL Injection

1. **Data Theft**: Attackers can read sensitive data (like usernames, passwords, credit card details).
2. **Data Modification**: Attackers can alter data in the database (e.g., update balances or permissions).
3. **Authentication Bypass**: Attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms by manipulating SQL queries.
4. **Data Destruction**: Attackers can delete data, tables, or even drop entire databases.
5. **Remote Code Execution**: In certain cases, attackers can escalate to executing commands on the database server.

---

### Steps to Find SQL Injection Vulnerability

1. **Identify Inputs**: 
   - Look for user inputs that directly interact with the database, like login forms, search fields, or URL parameters.

2. **Test with Simple SQL Injection**:
   - Start with a basic payload like `‘ OR ‘1’=’1` or `'; --` to see if the query is altered.

3. **Use Boolean-Based SQL Injection**:
   - Insert payloads that return true/false results, such as:
     - `‘ OR ‘1’=’1` (true)
     - `‘ OR ‘1’=’2` (false)
   - Check if results differ, which indicates injection is possible.

4. **Error-Based Injection**:
   - Use payloads that can produce database errors to reveal information about the database, like `‘ AND 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT @@version))`.

5. **Blind SQL Injection**:
   - Blind SQL is used when errors are hidden, and the page doesn’t display output directly. Inject queries that provide true/false responses, which require more probing.

6. **Automate Testing**:
   - Tools like SQLMap, Burp Suite, and OWASP ZAP can automate SQL Injection testing to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.

---

### Mitigation and Prevention

1. **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements)**:
   - Use parameterized queries to separate SQL code from user inputs, which prevents direct injection.
   - **Example in Java**:
     ```java
     String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";
     PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(query);
     stmt.setString(1, username);
     stmt.setString(2, password);
     ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();
     ```

2. **Stored Procedures**:
   - Use stored procedures that are precompiled in the database, which helps separate input and code.
   - **Example in SQL**:
     ```sql
     CREATE PROCEDURE GetUser(@username NVARCHAR(50))
     AS
     BEGIN
         SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = @username;
     END
     ```

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate input length, type, and format (e.g., disallow special characters if not necessary).
   - Implement a whitelist for expected input types and values.

4. **Least Privilege Principle**:
   - Restrict database user permissions. The application should only have access to what it strictly needs.

5. **Use Web Application Firewalls (WAF)**:
   - A WAF can help detect and block SQLi payloads in web requests.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Avoid displaying detailed database error messages to users. Use generic error messages to avoid disclosing database structure or errors.

---

### Summary

SQL Injection vulnerabilities are critical security issues that can lead to data breaches, loss of integrity, and complete control over databases. To prevent them, use **parameterized queries**, **stored procedures**, and **input validation** techniques, following the principle of least privilege and implementing a WAF for added protection. Regular testing and patching are also key to maintaining secure applications.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown of a Payload in SQL Injection

1. **Application Query Structure**:
   - Suppose an application has a simple login feature where the query checks user credentials in the database:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'inputUsername' AND password = 'inputPassword';
     ```
   - Here, `inputUsername` and `inputPassword` are supposed to be supplied by the user through input fields.

2. **Injection Point Identification**:
   - An attacker identifies that the application doesn’t sanitize inputs, meaning the application will execute whatever SQL is passed to it.
   - The attacker then inputs a specially crafted payload in one of the fields, such as:
     ```sql
     ' OR '1'='1
     ```
   - If injected into the `username` field, the query would now look like this:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = 'inputPassword';
     ```

3. **How the Payload Works**:
   - The payload `' OR '1'='1` is designed to modify the SQL logic.
   - In the modified query, the condition `OR '1'='1'` always evaluates to **true**.
   - As a result, the database will retrieve all records or bypass authentication because one condition (`1=1`) is always true, regardless of the actual username and password.

4. **Implications of Different Payload Types**:
   - **Boolean-based Payloads**: These inject conditions that return `true` or `false` to test for vulnerabilities.
   - **Error-based Payloads**: These inject faulty SQL commands to trigger error messages, which can reveal database details.
   - **Union-based Payloads**: These allow attackers to pull data from additional tables using the `UNION` SQL command.
   - **Blind SQL Injection Payloads**: When the application does not return error messages, attackers use time-based payloads (like `SLEEP(5)`) to confirm injection success by observing response times.

5. **Example of a Login Bypass Payload**:
   - If the payload `admin' --` is injected, it could comment out the rest of the SQL statement:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' -- ' AND password = 'anyPassword';
     ```
   - In SQL, `--` comments out the rest of the query, so only `username = 'admin'` is evaluated, bypassing the password check entirely.

### Preventing SQL Injection Payloads

The most effective way to prevent SQL Injection is through **prepared statements (parameterized queries)**, **input validation**, and **least privilege access** in the database. These techniques ensure that user inputs are treated as data rather than executable code, rendering injected payloads ineffective.

## FOR EXTRA Knowledge (not necessary)
---
In SQL and application development, there are various ways to construct and execute queries, each with different methods, security levels, and performance considerations. Here’s a breakdown of some key types of query construction methods, along with examples:

---

### 1. **Direct Queries (Non-Parameterized Queries)**
   - **Description**: Direct queries involve directly embedding user input into the SQL query string, often through string concatenation. These are **vulnerable to SQL injection** if inputs aren’t properly sanitized.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "' AND password = '" + password + "'";
     ```
   - **Risk**: Unsafe if user input is not sanitized, as attackers can inject malicious SQL code.

---

### 2. **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements)**
   - **Description**: Parameterized queries use placeholders (`?`) for input values. These are **recommended for preventing SQL injection** because the query and parameters are sent to the database separately, treating inputs strictly as data.
   - **Example** (Java PreparedStatement):
     ```java
     String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";
     PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(query);
     stmt.setString(1, username);
     stmt.setString(2, password);
     ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();
     ```
   - **Benefits**: Protects against SQL injection, more secure and efficient for repeated queries.

---

### 3. **Stored Procedures**
   - **Description**: Stored procedures are precompiled SQL code stored in the database that applications can call by name. Parameters are passed to the procedure, reducing the risk of SQL injection when properly implemented.
   - **Example** (SQL Server):
     ```sql
     CREATE PROCEDURE GetUserInfo
         @username NVARCHAR(50)
     AS
     BEGIN
         SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = @username;
     END;
     ```
   - **Invocation** (Java):
     ```java
     CallableStatement stmt = connection.prepareCall("{CALL GetUserInfo(?)}");
     stmt.setString(1, username);
     ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();
     ```
   - **Benefits**: Improves security, reusable and efficient, with logic encapsulated in the database.

---

### 4. **Dynamic Queries**
   - **Description**: Dynamic queries are SQL queries built at runtime based on varying conditions. They can be used with parameters to minimize risk, but if concatenated directly with user input, they can be **prone to SQL injection**.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     String query = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '" + category + "'";
     if (inStockOnly) {
         query += " AND stock > 0";
     }
     Statement stmt = connection.createStatement();
     ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);
     ```
   - **Risk**: Vulnerable if user input isn’t sanitized, especially when conditions are appended directly.

Here's how the response about dynamic queries can be formatted using GitHub's collapsible sections with headers. You can copy and paste this Markdown into your GitHub README or other Markdown-supported files.

<summary><strong>Dynamic Query</strong></summary>

**Dynamic Queries** are SQL queries that are built "dynamically" at runtime, meaning they are constructed based on different conditions or inputs that may vary with each execution. Unlike static queries, which are written once and stay the same, dynamic queries adjust to the input parameters, allowing for greater flexibility.

### Why Use Dynamic Queries?
Dynamic queries are useful when you need to build flexible queries that can handle varying conditions. For instance, if you have a search feature where users can filter by different criteria like "category," "price range," or "availability," a dynamic query can adjust based on which filters the user selects.

### How Dynamic Queries Work
Let's go through an example to make this clearer:

Imagine you have an online store with a "products" table, and you want to let users search for products based on:
- Category (e.g., electronics, clothing)
- Price range
- Availability (in stock only)

### Example Scenario: Building a Dynamic Query
In a static query, if you tried to account for all possible filters, it could become overly complex and difficult to manage. Instead, with a dynamic query, you can construct the SQL statement based on the criteria the user selects.

#### Example in Java (without using parameters for simplicity):
Suppose you want to fetch products based on optional filters.

```java
// Start with a basic query
String query = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE 1=1";

// Add conditions based on available filters
if (category != null) {
    query += " AND category = '" + category + "'";
}
if (minPrice != null) {
    query += " AND price >= " + minPrice;
}
if (maxPrice != null) {
    query += " AND price <= " + maxPrice;
}
if (inStockOnly) {
    query += " AND stock > 0";
}
```

This code builds the SQL query based on which filters are set. For example:
- If the user only selects a category, the query will include only that filter.
- If the user selects both a category and a price range, the query will include both conditions.

So, if the user chooses "electronics" as a category and sets a minimum price of $100, the resulting query would be:
```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE 1=1 AND category = 'electronics' AND price >= 100;
```

### Security Consideration
If this query is constructed without sanitizing user inputs, it can be vulnerable to SQL injection. Therefore, **always use parameterized queries** for dynamic queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

#### Secure Example (Java with Prepared Statements):
```java
String query = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE 1=1";
List<Object> params = new ArrayList<>();

if (category != null) {
    query += " AND category = ?";
    params.add(category);
}
if (minPrice != null) {
    query += " AND price >= ?";
    params.add(minPrice);
}
if (maxPrice != null) {
    query += " AND price <= ?";
    params.add(maxPrice);
}
if (inStockOnly) {
    query += " AND stock > 0";
}

PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(query);
for (int i = 0; i < params.size(); i++) {
    stmt.setObject(i + 1, params.get(i));
}
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();
```

### Key Takeaways:
- **Dynamic Queries**: Adapt to different conditions at runtime.
- **Flexibility**: Useful for search functionality and filtering.
- **Security**: Always use parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection risks.

### 5. **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) Queries**
   - **Description**: ORMs, such as Hibernate in Java or Entity Framework in .NET, provide a way to interact with the database using objects rather than raw SQL. ORM frameworks generally handle parameterization, reducing SQL injection risk.
   - **Example** (Hibernate):
     ```java
     List<User> users = session.createQuery("FROM User WHERE username = :username")
                               .setParameter("username", username)
                               .list();
     ```
   - **Benefits**: Simplifies database interactions, reduces SQL injection risks, and improves code readability.

---

### 6. **Raw SQL Queries with ORMs**
   - **Description**: Many ORM frameworks allow direct execution of raw SQL queries. These queries should use parameterization to ensure security.
   - **Example** (using JPA in Java):
     ```java
     Query query = entityManager.createNativeQuery("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?")
                                .setParameter(1, username);
     List<User> users = query.getResultList();
     ```
   - **Benefits**: Flexibility to write custom SQL while leveraging ORM features. Must be cautious about injection risks when using raw SQL.

---

### 7. **LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) for SQL (Specific to .NET)**
   - **Description**: LINQ is used in .NET environments to write SQL-like queries against data collections. LINQ to SQL uses parameterized queries automatically, protecting against SQL injection.
   - **Example**:
     ```csharp
     var users = dbContext.Users.Where(u => u.Username == username).ToList();
     ```
   - **Benefits**: Highly secure against SQL injection, as parameters are handled automatically.
