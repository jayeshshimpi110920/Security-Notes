### SQL Injection (SQLi) Vulnerability

**SQL Injection (SQLi)** is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to interfere with the queries an application makes to its database. It occurs when an application improperly sanitizes user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This can lead to unauthorized access to data, data modification, and, in severe cases, complete control over the database server.

> SQL Injection (SQLi) is a vulnerability where an attacker manipulates a web application's SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code into input fields (e.g., login forms, search boxes). This allows attackers to access, modify, or delete database data and, in severe cases, control the database server.

### Impact of SQL Injection

1. **Data Theft**: Attackers can read sensitive data (like usernames, passwords, credit card details).
2. **Data Modification**: Attackers can alter data in the database (e.g., update balances or permissions).
3. **Authentication Bypass**: Attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms by manipulating SQL queries.
4. **Data Destruction**: Attackers can delete data, tables, or even drop entire databases.
5. **Remote Code Execution**: In certain cases, attackers can escalate to executing commands on the database server.

### Steps to Find SQL Injection Vulnerability

1. **Identify Inputs**: 
   - Look for user inputs that directly interact with the database, like login forms, search fields, or URL parameters.

2. **Test with Simple SQL Injection**:
   - Start with a basic payload like `‘ OR ‘1’=’1` or `'; --` to see if the query is altered.

3. **Use Boolean-Based SQL Injection**:
   - Insert payloads that return true/false results, such as:
     - `‘ OR ‘1’=’1` (true)
     - `‘ OR ‘1’=’2` (false)
   - Check if results differ, which indicates injection is possible.

4. **Error-Based Injection**:
   - Use payloads that can produce database errors to reveal information about the database, like `‘ AND 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT @@version))`.

5. **Blind SQL Injection**:
   - Blind SQL is used when errors are hidden, and the page doesn’t display output directly. Inject queries that provide true/false responses, which require more probing.

6. **Automate Testing**:
   - Tools like SQLMap, Burp Suite, and OWASP ZAP can automate SQL Injection testing to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.

### Mitigation and Prevention

1. **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements)**:
   - Use parameterized queries to separate SQL code from user inputs, which prevents direct injection.
   - **Example in Java**:
     ```java
     String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";
     PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(query);
     stmt.setString(1, username);
     stmt.setString(2, password);
     ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();
     ```

2. **Stored Procedures**:
   - Use stored procedures that are precompiled in the database, which helps separate input and code.
   - **Example in SQL**:
     ```sql
     CREATE PROCEDURE GetUser(@username NVARCHAR(50))
     AS
     BEGIN
         SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = @username;
     END
     ```

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate input length, type, and format (e.g., disallow special characters if not necessary).
   - Implement a whitelist for expected input types and values.

4. **Least Privilege Principle**:
   - Restrict database user permissions. The application should only have access to what it strictly needs.

5. **Use Web Application Firewalls (WAF)**:
   - A WAF can help detect and block SQLi payloads in web requests.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Avoid displaying detailed database error messages to users. Use generic error messages to avoid disclosing database structure or errors.

### Summary

SQL Injection vulnerabilities are critical security issues that can lead to data breaches, loss of integrity, and complete control over databases. To prevent them, use **parameterized queries**, **stored procedures**, and **input validation** techniques, following the principle of least privilege and implementing a WAF for added protection. Regular testing and patching are also key to maintaining secure applications.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown of a Payload in SQL Injection

1. **Application Query Structure**:
   - Suppose an application has a simple login feature where the query checks user credentials in the database:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'inputUsername' AND password = 'inputPassword';
     ```
   - Here, `inputUsername` and `inputPassword` are supposed to be supplied by the user through input fields.

2. **Injection Point Identification**:
   - An attacker identifies that the application doesn’t sanitize inputs, meaning the application will execute whatever SQL is passed to it.
   - The attacker then inputs a specially crafted payload in one of the fields, such as:
     ```sql
     ' OR '1'='1
     ```
   - If injected into the `username` field, the query would now look like this:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = 'inputPassword';
     ```

3. **How the Payload Works**:
   - The payload `' OR '1'='1` is designed to modify the SQL logic.
   - In the modified query, the condition `OR '1'='1'` always evaluates to **true**.
   - As a result, the database will retrieve all records or bypass authentication because one condition (`1=1`) is always true, regardless of the actual username and password.

4. **Implications of Different Payload Types**:
   - **Boolean-based Payloads**: These inject conditions that return `true` or `false` to test for vulnerabilities.
   - **Error-based Payloads**: These inject faulty SQL commands to trigger error messages, which can reveal database details.
   - **Union-based Payloads**: These allow attackers to pull data from additional tables using the `UNION` SQL command.
   - **Blind SQL Injection Payloads**: When the application does not return error messages, attackers use time-based payloads (like `SLEEP(5)`) to confirm injection success by observing response times.

5. **Example of a Login Bypass Payload**:
   - If the payload `admin' --` is injected, it could comment out the rest of the SQL statement:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' -- ' AND password = 'anyPassword';
     ```
   - In SQL, `--` comments out the rest of the query, so only `username = 'admin'` is evaluated, bypassing the password check entirely.

### Preventing SQL Injection Payloads

The most effective way to prevent SQL Injection is through **prepared statements (parameterized queries)**, **input validation**, and **least privilege access** in the database. These techniques ensure that user inputs are treated as data rather than executable code, rendering injected payloads ineffective.
