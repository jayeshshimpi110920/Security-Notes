Sure! Below are example SAST tool outputs for the vulnerabilities mentioned earlier. Each output includes details about the vulnerability, the file and line number, and a recommendation for how to fix the issue.

---

### 1. **SQL Injection**

```text
Issue: SQL Injection Vulnerability
File: /app/src/UserService.java
Line: 42
Description: User input is being directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing for potential SQL injection attacks.
Recommendation: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to safely handle user input.
Example Fix: 
    PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?");
    stmt.setString(1, username);
    stmt.setString(2, password);
    ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();
```

---

### 2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

```text
Issue: Reflected XSS Vulnerability
File: /app/src/DisplayPage.jsp
Line: 109
Description: User input from the query string is rendered directly onto the page without escaping, which can lead to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
Recommendation: Ensure user input is sanitized or escaped before being inserted into the HTML page.
Example Fix: 
    String safeUsername = HtmlUtils.htmlEscape(request.getParameter("username"));
    out.println("<h1>Hello, " + safeUsername + "</h1>");
```

---

### 3. **Buffer Overflow**

```text
Issue: Buffer Overflow
File: /app/src/FileProcessor.c
Line: 25
Description: The `strcpy()` function is being used to copy user input into a fixed-size buffer, leading to potential buffer overflow and memory corruption.
Recommendation: Use safe alternatives such as `strncpy()` or ensure proper bounds checking before copying data into buffers.
Example Fix: 
    strncpy(buffer, userInput, sizeof(buffer) - 1);
    buffer[sizeof(buffer) - 1] = '\0';  // Ensure null-termination.
```

---

### 4. **Command Injection**

```text
Issue: Command Injection Vulnerability
File: /app/src/ServerCommandHandler.java
Line: 98
Description: User input is being directly passed to the system shell in the `Runtime.exec()` method without sanitization, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary commands.
Recommendation: Avoid using user input in system commands. If it's necessary, validate and sanitize input to prevent malicious command injection.
Example Fix: 
    String command = "ls -l " + sanitize(userInput);
    Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command);
```

---

### 5. **Insecure Cryptography**

```text
Issue: Use of Weak Cryptographic Algorithm
File: /app/src/PasswordManager.java
Line: 78
Description: The application uses the MD5 hash function for storing passwords, which is considered insecure and susceptible to collision attacks.
Recommendation: Use a strong, modern cryptographic algorithm such as bcrypt, PBKDF2, or Argon2 for password hashing.
Example Fix:
    PasswordHasher.hash(password, PasswordHasher.BCRYPT);
```

---

### 6. **Hardcoded Credentials**

```text
Issue: Hardcoded Credentials
File: /app/src/DatabaseConnection.java
Line: 56
Description: Sensitive information such as database credentials are hardcoded directly in the source code.
Recommendation: Avoid hardcoding sensitive data. Use environment variables or a secure secrets management system to store credentials.
Example Fix: 
    String dbPassword = System.getenv("DB_PASSWORD");
```

---

### 7. **Path Traversal**

```text
Issue: Path Traversal Vulnerability
File: /app/src/FileManager.java
Line: 103
Description: User input is directly concatenated to a file path, allowing attackers to traverse the file system and access sensitive files.
Recommendation: Validate and sanitize file paths before opening files to prevent path traversal attacks.
Example Fix:
    String filePath = sanitizeFilePath(request.getParameter("file"));
    File file = new File(filePath);
```

---

### 8. **Race Condition**

```text
Issue: Race Condition Vulnerability
File: /app/src/AccountService.java
Line: 142
Description: The application performs a check on a file’s existence and then modifies it, leaving a window for a race condition.
Recommendation: Use proper synchronization mechanisms to ensure atomicity of file operations or critical sections.
Example Fix:
    synchronized(this) {
        if (!file.exists()) {
            file.createNewFile();
        }
    }
```

---

### 9. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

```text
Issue: CSRF Vulnerability
File: /app/src/ChangePassword.jsp
Line: 92
Description: The password change form does not include any anti-CSRF tokens, making it vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
Recommendation: Implement CSRF tokens to verify that the request is coming from the authenticated user.
Example Fix:
    <form method="POST" action="/changePassword">
        <input type="hidden" name="csrfToken" value="${csrfToken}">
        ...
    </form>
```

---

### 10. **Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards**

```text
Issue: Unvalidated Redirect Vulnerability
File: /app/src/LoginHandler.java
Line: 67
Description: The application redirects users based on a URL parameter without validating it, allowing attackers to redirect users to malicious websites.
Recommendation: Validate and sanitize any URL parameter used in redirects.
Example Fix:
    String redirectUrl = validateRedirectUrl(request.getParameter("redirect"));
    response.sendRedirect(redirectUrl);
```

---

### 11. **Information Disclosure**

```text
Issue: Information Disclosure
File: /app/src/ErrorHandler.java
Line: 128
Description: Detailed error messages are exposed to the user, revealing stack traces, database schema, and file paths that may aid an attacker in exploiting the application.
Recommendation: Avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages, and log the details securely.
Example Fix:
    // Log the detailed error in a secure log file, but display a generic message to the user
    logger.error("Database error", e);
    response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, "An unexpected error occurred.");
```
