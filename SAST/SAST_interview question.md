### **Basic SAST Interview Questions**

1. **What is Static Application Security Testing (SAST)?**
   - **Answer**: SAST is a method of analyzing the source code, bytecode, or binary code of an application to identify vulnerabilities without executing the program. It examines the code at rest to detect issues like SQL injection, buffer overflows, and cross-site scripting (XSS).

2. **How does SAST differ from DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)?**
   - **Answer**: SAST analyzes an application’s code at rest (before execution), while DAST tests the application during runtime (executing the app) to identify vulnerabilities in the live environment.

3. **Why is SAST important in the software development lifecycle?**
   - **Answer**: SAST helps identify vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle, making it easier and cheaper to fix issues before the application is deployed into production.

4. **What are the primary benefits of using SAST?**
   - **Answer**: Early detection of vulnerabilities, faster remediation, integration with CI/CD pipelines, and no need for a running application.

5. **What is a false positive in the context of SAST?**
   - **Answer**: A false positive occurs when the SAST tool flags a vulnerability that does not actually exist in the application’s code.

6. **What types of vulnerabilities can SAST tools typically identify?**
   - **Answer**: SAST can identify SQL injection, XSS, command injection, buffer overflows, insecure data storage, improper error handling, and more.

8. **What is a code review in the context of SAST?**
   - **Answer**: A code review is a manual inspection of the source code, typically focused on identifying potential security flaws. It complements automated static analysis.

9. **Can SAST be applied to non-web applications?**
   - **Answer**: Yes, SAST can be applied to any application, including web, mobile, desktop, and embedded systems, as long as the **source code or binaries** are available for inspection.

10. **What is a signature-based SAST tool?**
    - **Answer**: A signature-based SAST tool detects known vulnerabilities by matching patterns in the code with predefined signatures of security flaws.

11. **What is a data flow analysis in SAST?**
    - **Answer**: Data flow analysis tracks the flow of data through an application to identify potential security issues, such as improper handling of user input.

12. **What role does SAST play in DevSecOps?**
    - **Answer**: SAST is a critical component of DevSecOps, enabling security to be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerabilities early in the development process.

13. **What is an open-source SAST tool?**
    - **Answer**: An open-source SAST tool is a static code analysis tool available for free and often supported by a community. Examples include SonarQube and Checkmarx.

14. **What are the limitations of SAST?**
    - **Answer**: SAST can produce false positives, might not identify vulnerabilities related to runtime behavior, and may not fully assess third-party libraries or APIs.

15. **What is an "impact analysis" in SAST?**
    - **Answer**: Impact analysis assesses the potential consequences of a vulnerability in the application, helping developers prioritize fixes based on the severity of the risk.

16. **What is a common limitation of using open-source static code analysis tools?**
    - **Answer**: Open-source tools may lack comprehensive support, have fewer features than commercial tools, or produce more false positives.

17. **What are security code smells?**
    - **Answer**: Security code smells are patterns or practices in code that may indicate potential security vulnerabilities or weaknesses.

18. **What is the role of a vulnerability database in SAST?**
    - **Answer**: A vulnerability database provides up-to-date information about known vulnerabilities, which SAST tools use to check against the application code for potential issues.

19. **What is a dependency analysis in SAST?**
    - **Answer**: Dependency analysis examines third-party libraries or dependencies used in the application to identify any known security issues with these components.

20. **What are the common challenges with SAST implementation?**
    - **Answer**: Challenges include handling false positives, integration with the existing development environment, scaling for large codebases, and the need for skilled security personnel to interpret results.

### **Medium SAST Interview Questions**

1. **Explain how SAST tools can integrate with CI/CD pipelines.**
   - **Answer**: SAST tools can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines by automatically scanning the code each time changes are pushed. Tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI can trigger SAST scans as part of the build process to ensure vulnerabilities are detected early.

2. **How do you perform a manual review of static code for security vulnerabilities?**
   - **Answer**: Manual review involves reading the code line by line to look for common vulnerabilities like improper input validation, insecure data handling, weak authentication mechanisms, and missing encryption.

3. **What is the difference between a "local" and "remote" vulnerability in SAST?**
   - **Answer**: A local vulnerability is one that can be exploited within the application’s code or configuration (e.g., insecure local files), while a remote vulnerability can be exploited from outside the application, often requiring external access (e.g., a web service exposed to the internet).

4. **What are some common security flaws detected by SAST tools in Java applications?**
   - **Answer**: Common flaws include SQL injection, improper input validation, weak cryptographic algorithms, hardcoded credentials, and XSS vulnerabilities.

5. **What is an OWASP Top 10 vulnerability, and how does SAST help in identifying it?**
   - **Answer**: The OWASP Top 10 is a list of the most critical web application security risks. SAST helps by identifying issues like SQL injection, XSS, broken authentication, and insecure deserialization in the code.

6. **What is the importance of data sanitization and validation in static application security testing?**
   - **Answer**: Data sanitization and validation help ensure that user inputs do not contain malicious data, thus preventing vulnerabilities like SQL injection or XSS.

7. **What is the significance of buffer overflows in SAST?**
   - **Answer**: Buffer overflows occur when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, which can lead to memory corruption and potential exploits. SAST can identify places in code where buffer overflows may occur.

8. **Explain how SAST helps prevent injection attacks like SQL injection.**
   - **Answer**: SAST scans for vulnerable code patterns where user input is improperly used in SQL queries without validation or escaping, identifying potential SQL injection points.

9. **What is the difference between white-box testing and black-box testing in security?**
   - **Answer**: White-box testing (SAST) involves testing with access to the internal code or structure of the application, while black-box testing (DAST) involves testing the application from an external perspective, without access to the code.

10. **What is a taint analysis in SAST?**
    - **Answer**: Taint analysis tracks untrusted data through the application to determine where it could be used in unsafe operations, helping to identify security vulnerabilities like injection flaws.

11. **What are secure coding standards, and how do they relate to SAST?**
    - **Answer**: Secure coding standards are guidelines for writing software that is secure from common vulnerabilities. SAST tools help enforce these standards by identifying violations in the code.

12. **How do you handle false positives when using SAST tools?**
    - **Answer**: False positives can be managed by refining the configuration of the tool, improving the accuracy of detection rules, or manually reviewing the flagged issues to validate whether they pose a real threat.

13. **How does SAST support compliance with standards like OWASP, PCI-DSS, or GDPR?**
    - **Answer**: SAST helps by identifying vulnerabilities that may violate compliance requirements, such as inadequate data protection, failure to properly sanitize user input, or improper encryption of sensitive data.

14. **Can SAST detect vulnerabilities in third-party libraries?**
    - **Answer**: Yes, if the SAST tool has a vulnerability database that includes known issues in third-party libraries, it can scan for these vulnerabilities as part of its analysis.

15. **What is a "security hotspot" in SAST?**
    - **Answer**: A security hotspot is a piece of code that has a high likelihood of containing vulnerabilities due to factors like complexity, sensitive data handling, or previous history of issues.

16. **How can SAST tools help identify issues with authentication and session management?**
    - **Answer**: SAST tools can identify issues like hardcoded credentials, weak password policies, insecure session management, or improper handling of tokens in the code.

17. **What is the role of configuration files in SAST?**
    - **Answer**: Configuration files are often sources of security issues (e.g., hardcoded secrets, incorrect access controls). SAST can scan these files to identify misconfigurations.

18. **What is a "root cause analysis" in the context of SAST?**
    - **Answer**: Root cause analysis helps understand the underlying reason for a security issue by tracing it back to
