# Security-Concepts-and-Definitions

1. **What is a security threat?**  
   **Definition:** A security threat is a potential danger that exploits vulnerabilities to harm systems, data, or networks.  
   **Example:** A hacker attempting to gain unauthorized access to a web application.

2. **What is a vulnerability?**  
   **Definition:** A vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a system, software, or network that can be exploited by threats.  
   **Example:** SQL injection, unpatched software, weak passwords.

3. **What is a security risk?**  
   **Definition:** A security risk refers to the potential damage or loss that could happen when a vulnerability is exploited by a threat.  
   **Example:** Loss of customer data due to a vulnerability being exploited in a web application.

4. **What is the difference between a vulnerability and a threat?**  
   **Definition:** Vulnerability is a weakness in the system, while a threat is something that could exploit that weakness.  
   **Example:** The vulnerability could be an outdated software version, and the threat could be a hacker using an exploit to take control of the application.

5. **What is the OWASP Top 10?**  
   **Definition:** OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Top 10 is a list of the most critical security risks to web applications, published by OWASP.  
   **Key Risks:** Injection (e.g., SQL Injection), Broken Authentication, Sensitive Data Exposure, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), etc.

6. **What is an attack vector?**  
   **Definition:** An attack vector is the path or method used by a hacker to access a system or network and exploit vulnerabilities.  
   **Example:** Phishing emails, malicious URLs, or unpatched software.

7. **What are false positives and false negatives in security testing?**  
   - **False Positive:** When a security tool flags something as a vulnerability, but it is not an actual risk.  
   - **False Negative:** When a security tool misses a real vulnerability that should have been flagged.

8. **What is the principle of least privilege (PoLP)?**  
   **Definition:** This principle states that users or systems should be granted the minimal level of access necessary to perform their job functions to reduce the attack surface.  
   **Example:** An intern should not have admin access to the companyâ€™s critical systems.

9. **What is the CIA Triad?**  
   - **Confidentiality:** Ensuring that data is only accessible to those authorized to view it.  
   - **Integrity:** Ensuring that data is accurate and not tampered with.  
   - **Availability:** Ensuring that data and systems are available when needed by authorized users.

10. **What is encryption?**  
    **Definition:** Encryption is the process of converting information into a secure format (ciphertext) that cannot be easily understood by unauthorized people.  
    **Example:** HTTPS encrypts the communication between a browser and a website.

11. **What is a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack?**  
    **Definition:** A DDoS attack is when multiple systems flood a targeted system (e.g., a server) with traffic, causing it to slow down or become unavailable to legitimate users.  
    **Mitigation:** Using firewalls, load balancers, and intrusion detection systems (IDS).

12. **What is multi-factor authentication (MFA)?**  
    **Definition:** MFA is a security mechanism that requires two or more forms of verification before allowing access.  
    **Example:** A user enters a password and then a code sent to their mobile phone.

13. **What is cross-site scripting (XSS)?**  
    **Definition:** XSS is a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.  
    **Mitigation:** Validating and sanitizing user input, using Content Security Policy (CSP).

14. **What is SQL Injection (SQLi)?**  
    **Definition:** SQLi is an attack where an attacker can execute malicious SQL queries against a database by manipulating the user input.  
    **Mitigation:** Using prepared statements and parameterized queries.

15. **SQL injection**
    its a vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code to access senstivie data.

16. **What is a secure socket layer (SSL)?**
Answer: SSL is a cryptographic protocol that provides secure communication between a website and its users.

17. **CSRF (cross-site Request forgery)**
    its a vulnerability that allows an attacker to trick a user into unknowingly submitting a malicious request to a web application where the user is authenticated. This attack mostly carried out using social engg such as link to tricl the victim into sending a forged request to a server. (its a way of impersonating the user to peform unauthorized actions.) 
    > **cross-site** - used 2 interacting (trusted website & malicious code)
    > **request** - request sent from user browers to server, asking to perform some action., CSRF referes to state-changing request that might modify user data, perform action(like bank transfer) or update a user profile.
    > **Forgery** - refers to  action being performed fradulently or without the users consent.

1. **What is the difference between a vulnerability scan and a penetration test?**
Answer: A vulnerability scan is an automated process that detects potential vulnerabilities, while a penetration test is a manual process that simulates a real-world attack to exploit vulnerabilities. 

2. **What is Burp Suite?**
Answer: Burp Suite is a popular tool used for web application penetration testing, providing features such as proxying, scanning, and vulnerability identification.


---
1) **SQL injection - (Repeter)**
   intercept the proxy and send it to repeter and find parameters that could be susceptible to SQL injection try out different payload
   > ' OR 1=1; --
and check response and length of output in burpsuite, unexpected results.

2) **Cross-site scripting(XSS) (Repeter)**
   Same as SQl just need to try out XSS payload in user input fields.
   > <script>alert('XSS')</script> if payload execute in brower, XSS exists.

3) **Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)**
   from repeter right click from engagement tool go to generate CSRF PoC (if pro version in burpsuite) in communitiy need to do html form tag maually to exploit
Prevention:
> * Anti-CSRF token - a unique token is generated for each session or request, this token must be included in state-changing request(like form submissions) and verified by server.
> * samesite cookies - setting **sameSite** attribute on cookies can help prevent browers from sending cookies with cross-site requestes.
> * User interaction : requiring user confirmation for sensitive action can add an extra layer of protection
